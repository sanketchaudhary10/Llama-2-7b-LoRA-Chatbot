    ["i'm sorry to hear that you are feeling as if you're in a slump. first of all, nothing is wrong with you. many people report similar symptoms. have you ever talked with a physician regarding your symptoms? two extreme emotions such as feeling extremely happy and then feeling extremely low for a length of time may indicate a mood disorder. i think it would be best to talk with your doctor or a therapist to help pinpoint the issue causing them. it's possible that it could just be certain stressors in your life that are causing the two extremities but you definitely want to rule out any mental health issues. if it is in fact mental health related there are many medications or therapy choices that can help and thanks for reaching out! i hope that you will feel back on track soon!"],
   1["in general, the answer is no. depression can not not generally cause ptsd your question does make a lot of sense, though. depression is a common symptom of ptsd.a counselor in your area should be able to help you what's going on - either feelings of depression, ptsd, or both."],
    ["frequently when working with clients, i utilize the a-b-c model developed by albert ellis, the founder of rational emotive behavior theory. the theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. for instance here is an example: a (action or event): you need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back b (behavior or response): you begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or i am not important to this person c (consequence): you feel depressed.if you look at the model, b has a direct effect on c. the thought is if you change your reaction to a, then c will have a better consequence, such as a: stays the same b (this is what you change): this person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or i can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available: decreased feelings of depression overall functioning improves.this is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve. if this model resonates with you, i recommend feeling better, getting better, staying better and by alber ellis. in addition, looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone."],
   1["what you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. you have been triangulated by your wife and mother.this is often seen in families. it's seen everywhere. how many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? it is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. for example, i bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.i'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. that's what therapists do every day! sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. however, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. you are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love if you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle and try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. it is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. these are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. i heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. the wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. the wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. if your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. from your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. if you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. this can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. i am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. these are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours and regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. they will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. they will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. in worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. change the dynamics before it spirals even further."],
    ["i'm sorry you are feeling uncared for. i'm sure there are plenty of people that care and love for you that you are not taking into consideration. sometimes when we get upset we may think irrationally and see the world as all or nothing. however, take a deep breath, relax and start focusing on the positive relationships you have with others, regardless of how small or insignificant they may seem. i think you will quickly realize there are people out there that care a great deal about you i also think it would help for you to surround yourself among people who you can identify with and share common interests with. maybe you can attend a religious service, join an interest group (i.e. reading club, sports group, etc.) or start a group of your own. most importantly, you need to tap into your interests and surround yourself with things that are beneficial for your own mental and physical health. from this, relationships will start to immerse and you may also like to talk with a therapist regarding your feelings of being unloved. this is an unhealthy way to think of yourself and i think with a little help, you can see that you are more than deserving of a great relationship.thanks for reaching out and i wish you the best of luck moving forward."],

It's possible that there are underlying issues that need to be addressed, and by talking about them, they may be able to find common ground and work towards a resolution.

    "Hi there! I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling that way. It's important to remember that you are deserving of love and friendship, regardless of your perceived flaws or past experiences. It's understandable to feel self doubt and insecurity, but it's important to challenge those thoughts and try to focus on the positive aspects of yourself and your relationships.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to have flaws and make mistakes. Everyone does! It's important to try to be kind to yourself and to focus on your strengths rather than your weaknesses. If you're feeling really struggling with these feelings, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor. They can help you work through these feelings and develop more positive self-talk and coping strategies. Remember, you are deserving of love and friendship, and it's okay to take time to work on your own self-esteem and self-worth. You are worth it!"
