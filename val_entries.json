want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. the website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. if you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. it may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. i am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the lgbtq community. so, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. in addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. an ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. if there are some lgbtq resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. gaining more support from others would be helpful. sometimes lgbtq-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. finally, i know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but i also know that it is very common for people to consider\u00a0suicide when they are struggling
