# Mental Health Assistant Chatbot

# Overview
This repository contains the code for a Mental Health Assistant Chatbot, developed using the Llama2-7B model. The chatbot is fine-tuned with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique to provide relevant and empathetic responses in conversations about mental health. The goal of this project, titled "Generative AI for Mental Health", is to create a chatbot that can assist users in managing their mental health.

# Features
- Lama2-7B Model: The chatbot leverages the power of the Llama2-7B model, fine-tuned specifically for mental health-related conversations.
- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): The model is fine-tuned using LoRA, a technique that allows for efficient training with fewer parameters while maintaining high performance.
- Evaluation Metrics: The model's responses have been evaluated using BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and Perplexity Scores to ensure quality and relevance.
- Dataset: The chatbot is trained on a dataset consisting of conversations between patients and mental health professionals.
