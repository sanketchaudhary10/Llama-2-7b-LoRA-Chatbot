{"text": "### Human: my wife and mother are having tense disagreements. in the past, theyâ€™ve had minor differences. for example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.\nhowever, itâ€™s intensified lately. i think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. what can i do?### Assistant: <p>what you are describing is something psychologists have termed &#34;triangulation&#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. you have been &#34;triangulated&#34; by your wife and mother.</p><p>this is often seen in families. it's seen everywhere. how many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? it is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. for example, i bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.</p><p>i'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. that's what therapists do every day! sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. however, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. you are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.</p><p>if you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle.â </p><p>try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. it is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. these are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. i heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. the wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. the wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. if your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. from your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. if you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. this can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. i am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. these are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours.â </p><p>regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. they will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. they will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. in worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. change the dynamics before it spirals even further.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i'm planning to have baby, so i have to quit smoking - but it's hard. sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.\n\ni cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. what can i do to get rid of this addiction?### Assistant: <p>hi. good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). that's a great first step! it's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.</p><p>for the next steps, i would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. the psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. and if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. well, if i'm on a diet and i continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually i'll give in and eat it.</p><p>you're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. that's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. but you choose whether or not to continue thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. that's what you would have to work on changing. when you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (&#34;ok, i kind of want a cigarette now.&#34;), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.</p><p>i've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.</p><p>best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships. how can i fix my underlying issues?### Assistant: <p>hi there. it's great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. at the root of it is fear. fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. all those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don't lose them. the thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. vicious circle, right?â </p><p>what i would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. you can start with this assignment. write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. for example, thinking something like, &#34;i'm too pushy&#34;, can be rewritten as, &#34;i'm assertive and i go after what i want.&#34; it can be hard to do since we tend to get &#34;stuck&#34; in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. if you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.</p><p>finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that's not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. you've already taken the first step, so keep moving forward.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.### Assistant: <p>i suggest that you work on emotional awareness.â </p><p>emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.</p><p>emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions. in other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.</p><p>often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.</p><p>being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others.  being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.</p><p>many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions.  for example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness.  therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger.  being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear.  instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways.  if a man never learns to say â€œi am sadâ€ or â€œthat really hurt my feelingsâ€ and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.</p><p>you can control yourself and not explode.  walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out.  instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a â€œsimpleâ€ thing upset you.  what is the real feeling driving these outbursts?  maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern.â </p><p>it might help to keep an anger journal.  write down everything that gets you upset.  that might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off.  talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience.â </p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i've never been able to talk with my parents. my parents are in their sixties while i am a teenager. i love both of them but not their personalities. i feel that they do not take me seriously whenever i talk about a serious event in my life. if my dad doesnâ€™t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesnâ€™t believe me either. iâ€™m a pansexual, but i canâ€™t trust my own parents.\ni've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. i feel that my friends don't listen to me. i know they have their own problems, which i do my best to help with. but they don't always try to help me with mine, when i really need them. i feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. i feel as if i have no one whom i can trust.### Assistant: <p>hi there. being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life. i remember when i was 15 and how i often felt my parents werenâ€™t listening to me. itâ€™s even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in.â </p><p>having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything! depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through. in addition to the communication problem with your parents, it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety. we all have stress and anxiety in our lives. if we didnâ€™t, none of us would be living. anxiety &amp; stress keep us on our toes! often, i have to remind myself of this as well. however, it is how we manage stress and anxiety, so it will not overcome our lives.â </p><p>are you familiar with relaxation techniques, such as: deep breathing exercises, meditation or yoga? relaxation techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety.â </p><p>deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go, such as school, shopping, out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in.  most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity. i know, that sounds silly. but, itâ€™s true. you would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold. imagine being in the doctorâ€™s office and taking deep breaths. this is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed and/or stressed. take a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly. you will be surprised how well you feel afterwards.â </p><p>meditation and yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety. you will need a quiet place for your meditation. you want to be â€œin the momentâ€ and take in the peace and serenity. all it takes is a quiet place, closing your eyes and thinking of your â€œhappy place.â€ some people use meditation music as well. if you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation, please go for it!â </p><p>yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice. i would not suggest you learning this on your own, if you have never attempted yoga before. find an experienced yoga instructor to teach you the ropes and/or ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students.â </p><p>lastly, in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating. i would recommend writing a letter to them, if you are unable to express how you feel in person. a letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end. if they are open on working on this relationship, maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue.</p><p>â i hope this was helpful for you and i wish you the best!â </p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i have been with this guy on and off for 8 years. at first, we used to do things together and our sex life was ok. then things started to change, we'd break up and reconnect, and he cheated on me numerous times.  we've also had two beautiful baby girls during this time. now we argue and he says i am not affectionate at all or i don't know how to please a man, when i work part-time, take care of a 2 year old and a 5 month old and cook. sometimes he cooks, but he also spends a lot of time on the internet. in addition, i have 2 boys and he has 1 son. i feel somewhere i have lost something. it's not that i donâ€™t care, i truly love this guy, but i'm just tired of being the one who is always being judged. please, i am in need of a christian counselor to help us because i really need to speak to someone.### Assistant: <p>i don't think youâ€™ve lost something, i think youâ€™ve found something - your breaking point, and it's about time. your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when it's convenient for him. obviously, he has his own issues, but i want to address yours. i agree you need to talk to someone. the fact that youâ€™ve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it (by saying you're not affectionate enough, etc.), tells me you probably have low self-esteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you don't deserve any better. you do! you may truly love this guy, but based on his behaviors, he does not love you, not in the way you deserve. â and although you may want to believe he can change, he has proved over and over again that he's not willing to, so you need to do what is best for you and your children. what would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way? would you want your sons to treat women this way? that's what you're teaching your children when they see this.</p><p>like i said, i agree that you should talk to someone. you can ask your boyfriend to go too, but my guess is he won't. even if he does, you should still see someone individually to work on you. i understand it's not easy to just kick him out, especially since you have children together, but a counselor can help you talk through all the details whileâ helping you raise your self-esteem and self-worth.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i keep hearing i am attractive from people around me, and i think i believe it. but i have low confidence regarding approaching girls i like.### Assistant: <p>i recommend that you focus on the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs that are going through your mind at the time in which you are trying to approach a girl. when you are aware of the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs, you can then work on changing them. an easy way to recognize an irrational belief is a thought that contains the words &#34;must or never.&#34; once you recognize the thought or belief, i would like you to picture a big red stop sign. this is called thought stopping. this is a technique to use to stop unwanted or unhealthy thoughts. then, i would like you to think of a more positive thought to replace it with such as: negative thought: &#34;that girl will never go out with me&#34; stop positive thought: &#34;i won't know if she will go out with me unless i ask&#34;. what this does is increase your self confidence by replacing your negative thoughts with positive ones that will ultimately boost your self esteem.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: my husband and i would've been married for five years come june 2016. our infant daughter just had her birthday. shortly before, he told me he wanted a divorce. he has four other children, three of which are from his first wife. he decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant. the children do not have a good relationship with him now. he has another child from a woman he was dating. he decided he didn't want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant. \n\nit seems to me that there is a pattern. he easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the child's life but wants a relationship with them when they are older. i've tried to research online, but i'm not getting any answers. he also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bi-polar disorder. he also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals. is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have? where do you recommend researching this?### Assistant: this sounds really difficult and i can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred - especially if your husband (who sounds like he is an ex-husband?) continues to have a relationship with you and your children. with that being said - relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for. in order for someone to be diagnosed with a <a href=\"http://www.coupletherapytoronto.com/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy-resources/articles/how-do-i-know-if-i-have-a-mental-illness\">mental illness</a> or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular <a href=\"http://www.coupletherapytoronto.com/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy/couples-therapy-marriage-counselling/\">patterns in relationship</a> - they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges, something that you say your ex is not willing to do. &nbsp;while it might be a relief to understand what is going on with him - it might be more comforting for you to get support for yourself in processing your feelings and everything that has come up for you as a result of his choices.&nbsp;"}
{"text": "### Human: i was raped repeatedly when i was younger. i told my parents and action was taken, but now that iâ€™m an adult, i suffer from extreme anxiety.### Assistant: <p>while anxiety can come about for many reasons, trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life. when we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies - we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come. this is normal, natural and in many ways helpful - at least initially. this fear is in some way a sign that your body/mind is taking good care of you - trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again. however, as it sounds like you know, anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety. in order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life, i would encourage you to seek professional help and check out <a href=\"http://www.coupletherapytoronto.com/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy-resources/videos-additional-therapy-resources/\">anxiety resources </a>online. &nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: every once and a while, i think about my ex-boyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend. itâ€™s like i can't get past it, and i need some kind of closure. i keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. nothing was ever wrong with it. now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least i feel it when we're physically in the same place.\n\ntwo summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. i'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. despite the age difference, i know we're a really good match. we've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. i tell him everything. also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. heâ€™s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. that summer, i told him i didn't want anything serious and broke it off. only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. his girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. i'm sure she may be different around him, but i worry about him committing to her in the long run. they're supposed to move in together soon. but still, i feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and i feel like he does too. \n\ni don't know what to do. i need some closure or i'm not going to be able to move on from this. i don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. iâ€™m so happy with my current boyfriend, and i know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. heâ€™s such a good person. i also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but i can't get it out of my head. i'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but i can't sleep because my mind is racing. i've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.\n\ni want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but i don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. if he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. if my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. on one hand, i want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but i would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. where would i go from there? on the other hand, i feel like i can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. sometimes i wish i could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but i don't want to.\n\nplease help me, because i really have no idea what to do.### Assistant: <p>if you're in a relationship and you're having strong thoughts about someone else, it's important to pay attention to that. although you say you're happy, i'd suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether you're getting everything you need. is there a physical connection with your ex that you don't have with your current boyfriend? it could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just don't feel excited about him for some reason. that's a pretty important element to be missing.</p><p>it may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. if you feel the need to see what is possible there, i think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. you can't have everything.</p><p>if you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship. the grass isn't greener... a therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present, rather than an imagined version of the past or future.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: for the last year, my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting. i'm at my wits end. how can i get them to stop and get along?### Assistant: <p>that is a good question. unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one. kids fight for different reasons - wanting attention, wanting respect, feeling jealous, wanting space and to be left alone, or a whole bunch of other reasons. regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting, most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them.&nbsp;</p><p>these conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them. it is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong. the more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>one exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is \"active listening\" where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding. this is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are. if this doesn't work it may be time to get a <a href=\"https://nat-roman.squarespace.com/config#/pages|/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy/couples-therapy-marriage-counselling\">family therapist </a>or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict.&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i've worked with this guy for about three years now, and i knew the first time i saw him that i was attracted. over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. there was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. we agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, i hoped it would become something more. it didn't, and three months later, i'm still not over it.\n\ni'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. we're no longer in the same office, which i thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so i'm still very drawn to him. he's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so i find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. he's younger than me and prefers model types, but i see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. how do i get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?### Assistant: <p>it sounds like a tricky situation. if you want to maintain your friendship and continue to have regular contact with him, getting over him may not be possible. what makes it even trickier is that his actions (hugs and touching) may be misleading and are allowing you to believe that a romantic relationship is possible. some ways in which we naturally get over others are when we fall in love with someone else or when we suddenly see the person we like in a more negative or unattractive light. if you truly want to force yourself to get over him, cutting contact&nbsp;or setting strict boundaries may be necessary. if you don't see him, over time you can begin to forget about him. if you set boundaries by discontinuing to allow the hugs and touches, you will not feel mislead or&nbsp;have the idea in your mind that he is being flirtatious or interested.&nbsp;it would be difficult to continue the relationship as is and expect your feelings&nbsp;to change. thus, being proactive by talking to him about boundaries or cutting contact with him are two things you can do that will likely help you to get over him. good luck!&nbsp;<br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. whenever i get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. this anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. while a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, itâ€™s an emotional nightmare i canâ€™t get to the bottom of. iâ€™ve had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time i made contact with my crush. what could be the reason behind this? is it massive nerve problems? is it a fear of a bad relationship?\n\nwhile iâ€™m not quite ready to be in one anyway, i want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which i can be in one. i donâ€™t take medications and have no desire to, i have read forums, and iâ€™ve talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.### Assistant: <p>hi helena,</p><p>i felt a bit sad when i read this. this is a new term for me... \"semi-relationship\". what does it mean? i know that today's culture for young people is more of a \"hook-up\" culture than a dating one. maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. that makes me feel sad. i hear a lot of young women (i'm not sure you're female, but that's my guess) say that they struggle with hook-ups because they can't let themselves hope for a phone call after a hook-up. research tells us that, after a hook-up, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. i think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.</p><p>this is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it's okay to want or expect that.</p><p>maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. anxiety tends to try to convince us that something's wrong with us or something bad's going to happen. anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague (it's more difficult to refute it then), but you can try to clarify it's whisperings by asking yourself these questions: what am i afraid of? what is the worst thing that might happen here? then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?</p><p>then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and i bet you'd find a place where that idea or fear originated. a big moment (or many smaller ones) when you actually did feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. in the end, it's a feeling you're trying to avoid (not life or relationship), and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. but this doesn't work for you! good! with the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i'm supposed to stay here the rest of my academic life, but i've never liked it here, not even before i came. iâ€™ve never felt like i belong, iâ€™ve missed my country every second in the past four months, and i'm just miserable. i'm gaining weight, doing nothing, and crying for hours straight. is it time to go back home or is it just culture shock?### Assistant: <p>it sounds like you are feeling very unsure and out of place and the prospect of continuing to feel as you do now for the remainder of schooling seems daunting. without getting to know more about you and your experiences here and at home, it is hard to say what you should do, however, i think exploring these things with a competent therapist may help you to discover the answer.<br></p>"}
{"text": "### Human: hello, i have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled, insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city. i know she comes from a place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental if something doesn't work out the way she planned it. i have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication i seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed. \n\ni have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and i have never heard these comments from anyone else before. i have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether i truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundings/people, or positive, but in the end, i am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship. \n\nwhat can i do?### Assistant: <p>it sounds like you are feeling pretty criticized by your cousin and at the same time you are wondering whether or not there is some truth in what she is saying. it also sounds like you would like to see if you can find a new way to relate to your cousin, so that your relationship can be more satisfying. if you can find a competent therapist to work with, there may be a great deal of opportunity to learn more about how you relate to people in the world and to learn strategies to show up in your relationship with your cousin in a way that feels right to you.<br></p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i've worked with this guy for about three years now, and i knew the first time i saw him that i was attracted. over time, he became a very dear friend, and we talked about our relationship problems, family, dreams, and so on. there was always flirtation with us, and one day pretty recently, it progressed to making out. we agreed to keep it quiet, and we did, but in the back of my mind, i hoped it would become something more. it didn't, and three months later, i'm still not over it.\n\ni'm trying so hard to maintain the friendship because that's what he wants. we're no longer in the same office, which i thought would help me get over these feelings, but we still talk about work, and he's constantly touching me, so i'm still very drawn to him. he's a hugger and such a sweet guy, so i find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be, but he's clearly not interested. he's younger than me and prefers model types, but i see him checking me out a lot, which gives me hope. how do i get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship?### Assistant: <p>it sounds like you have mixed feelings and motivations - which is understandable. on the one hand you want to get over him, on the other you are still holding out hope for something more. it will be really hard to let go of him and create friend boundaries so long as there is a part of you holding on to the idea of something more. if you are being really honest with yourself you might need to acknowledge that you are not really striving to get him out of your system - that you have not really given up hope of having a relationship with him. if you are whole-heartedly committed to moving past the <a href=\"http://www.coupletherapytoronto.com/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy-resources/articles/what-is-sex-therapy\">sexual and romantic parts of your relationship</a> and just having a friendship than refraining from all the touching would be a good place to start. it is hard to \"just be friends\" when all your sex and bonding hormones are coursing through your veins.&nbsp;</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: how do i make myself happy without the people who made me happy? now that theyâ€™re gone, i feel sad. itâ€™s been two months now but i seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.### Assistant: <p>it sounds like you have been feeling pretty down, since the loss of a relationship, and you're wondering how to be happy by yourself. intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same time learning to enjoy ourselves, even when we are alone, can strengthen our ability to lead a satisfying life in and out of relationship. working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into how you show up in your relationships with yourself and others and discover more fulfilling ways to do so.<br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now. in the past, our relationship was difficult and frustrating. we argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. we stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work. i used to party a lot, and several times i got into situations where i would end up kissing someone else. these situations were never more than just kissing. i have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend, and he decided to forgive and move forward with me. i love him so much and want to work things out too, but i'm having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me. i can't seem to forgive myself. i'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness.### Assistant: <p>hi cerritos,</p><p>this is an interesting twist because it's more common for the person in your position to want to move forward, and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness. you are lucky to have a loving, compassionate partner, and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions.&nbsp;</p><p>my hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here. your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made. you don't have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man. you only have to have the maturity to recognise when you've hurt someone and work hard to make it better. who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made? were you shamed as a child? did you learn that you deserved to be punished? did something bad happen that you thought was your fault? is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for? there is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they weren't entirely responsible for. the bar is too high for you. if i was your therapist, i would work with you to find the source of the shame, and address that wound.&nbsp;</p><p>if you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend, your job will be to forgive yourself. forgiving doesn't mean \"it was okay\"; forgiving simply means that it happened, that you can't erase it, and that you don't want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>you have done many things here that you can feel proud of! you've 'come clean', you've been honest, you've taken responsibility for your actions, you've not tried to minimize what you did, and you've chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend. these are all things you can use to build your sense of worth. you are acting very honourably. it's time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that you've learned from them and are a better person now. it's not our mistakes...not our worst moments that define us...it's how we handle them afterwards.</p><p>i wish you growth and happiness.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and i just had my first kiss five months ago. iâ€™m worried that, at this rate, i wonâ€™t have a boyfriend for a very long time. the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, i don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. i feel dirty by doing this, but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.\n\nmost people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking. i am tall, i play lots of sports, and i get excellent grades in school. i am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. it bothers me. most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. i feel like i will be single forever sometimes.### Assistant: i think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. it is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. we fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true!&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>there is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. while some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. when we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what i mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>when you are most <a href=\"http://www.coupletherapytoronto.com/therapy-counselling-psychotherapy-resources/articles/hope-in-the-midst-of-hopelessness\">afraid of being alone </a>- remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be \"normal\" or whatever that is anyway. hope this helps!&nbsp;</div>"}

{"text": "### Human: my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now. throughout the entire first day that we met, he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. that same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. the next two days were a repetition of the first day. on the third night, my mother finally caught us, and i was kicked out of my house. i left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. it was very hard for us. his stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot. our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. after that, it was a downward spiral. we were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. we kept having the famous \"you're doing it wrongâ€”do it this way\" argument. after six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. one afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. he told me to let him leave or he would hit me. he had once promised he would never touch me, so i challenged him to do it. he slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. i haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. i don't live with him, i don't depend on him, and we don't have children. we both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. he always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. i've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. i know he has to change that on his own. i just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? is there hope for a better future together?### Assistant: <p>hi winters, i learned a long time ago that i can't ever predict who will change and who won't. i meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but can't make it work, and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change. but in reading your story, the image of a slot machine came to mind. you're gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change. only you can decide how many years to give it. i see him giving you clear signs that he doesn't even believe in himself or want to change though. what are you waiting for?</p><p>although you say you know his behaviours aren't your fault, something tells me that you're hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change. it doesn't work that way. just like the slot machine, you have no power to change him or make this work. you can only decide when you've paid too much.&nbsp;</p><p>i bet there's someone out there who loves and misses you. he's not your only support.&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i'm a young adult woman, and i have trouble finding my true identity being at home. this all started when i had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. my boyfriend and i were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. at the time, i was pretty religious, but i let this happen. i don't know why. i felt kind of guilty but mostly because i know my parents wouldn't like it. my parents are very religiousâ€”they're christians. we did things every time he'd come over to my house. we didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.\n\none day, my parents found out i did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. as soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. they were both aggravated. they told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. they said he wanted me for sex and he's not a christian. i took their advice and broke up with him. once we broke up for about a month, i decided to get back together with him a little after school started. my parents found out eventually, and i decided to not listen this time. i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and god totally forbids him. i would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents. they're always yelling at me about how i shouldn't date this boy. i felt too old to listen to them. now i'm kind of just stuck. is the real me religious? have i been brainwashed by him? i don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think i'm deceiving because of it. they threatened me that if i'm still with him, i can't do track and they won't support me. they've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. i'm actually very happy with him. they also say i'm living a separate life at home than i am at school. they say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.### Assistant: <p>what a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. i would say the first thing you want to do is&nbsp;(if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting&nbsp;them know what you need from them. if communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. you, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the&nbsp;relationship you have with your parents. it always helps to try and see things from another angle. you might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. </p><p>are you living with your parents and do they support you? if so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow&nbsp;their rules? know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper.&nbsp;not everyone will always approve of the choices&nbsp;we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. best of luck to you.<br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). a while back (3 years ago), i asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. i caught him one night drinking behind my back. i confronted him and he lied, but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but i noticed it was every single night. i didn't like this. for our new yearâ€™s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. he was on boardâ€”no more drinking every night.\nthe other night, i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. it took a couple of days, but tonight, i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but i couldn't wait). i asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and i cannot sleepâ€”it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). he slurred a bit and said no. i asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. i went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. \ni'm not sure if i'm overreacting or not. i just feel like i'm so honest with him about everything, and i expect the same honesty. he is a good husband in every other regard.### Assistant: <p>hi los angeles,</p><p>so your husband is giving you mixed messages. he says he's willing to cut back on the drinking, but he drinks and hides it. his behaviour is passive aggressive and immature, which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent. it sounds more like you're talking about an out-of-control teenager than your partner.&nbsp;</p><p>your husband's lying is sending a message. \"i get to make my own decisions and you can't stop me\" might be it. underneath that, maybe it's \"i want to stop but i'm ashamed that i can't and i don't want you to see my failures\". ultimately, as an adult, he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has, you are pretty certain to get some fallout... pushback...backlash... &nbsp;</p><p>how does his drinking affect you? that's where your voice has power, rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie (when he's passed out, asking if he's been drinking seems confusing). you've mentioned snoring, which i guess is a legitimate complaint. if he's passing out, that's a legitimate complaint. when he drinks does he drive, act aggressively, or 'check out of' the relationship (avoid you)? all of these things are legitimate concerns, and i'd stick to talking about those rather than counting beers. my guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress, so he checks out with alcohol, and it also helps him avoid your relationship. but the problem is it makes it worse; the more he avoids you, then more you chase him with your questions.</p><p>there's a conversation that would be helpful here. &nbsp;it sounds like \"i've tried to support you in your drinking less, and it's not working. what are your goals for alcohol and how can i support you in that more effectively?\" i'd like to see you in a place where you're not micromanaging his drinking, but focusing on the things that affect you. what concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement? can we get the alcohol out of the house? is he willing to seek treatment?&nbsp;</p><p>lay your expectations out really clearly. \"i won't count your beers, but i can't tolerate lying\". you have to decide what's more important; is it really the number of beers, or is it something else. what do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage? what does he need? does he let you know what isn't okay with him? he might have trouble saying these things.&nbsp;</p><p>the drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage. a qualified therapist can assist in pulling this apart, understanding it, and changing the way you relate to each other.&nbsp;</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i am divorced and happily remarried. our blended family of children are in their 20s. my youngest, age 20, continues to call me crazy and favors her dad. he was abusive to me, and i left with injuries. he never wanted kids, and i did. he paid child support only through forced wage earners. now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices i made for them the past 15 years as a single mom. i donâ€™t deny them a relationship with their dad, but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core. iâ€™m not sure how to handle this.### Assistant: <p>hi arkansas,&nbsp;</p><p>your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation. your ex-partner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. it's a form of woman abuse and child abuse. he's likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you, and he's not considering how it's affecting the kids. i've seen this happen in many families; parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. in some cases, children actually stop having contact with one parent, who is left bewildered and powerless. it's your ex's job to support your relationship with your kids, not try to destroy it.&nbsp;</p><p>while you can't change his behaviours, and i think you know that, there are things you can do for yourself and your kids.&nbsp;</p><p>for your children, you can refuse to enter into the war he's setting up. he's trying to provoke you into acting \"crazy\", but you don't have to fall for this. if you run around screaming \"he's lying!\", it only makes you look more 'crazy'. try to stay calm, and don't put their dad down to them, no matter how tempting it is. one day, they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father, but wait until they ask. trust that they have their own experience of their dad, and trust that he doesn't have the power to destroy their love for you. children, in the long term, lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. they see who their dad is already, i'd bet, but they don't know how to cope with that. if he's the only one fighting a war, you're helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. don't engage on his level.&nbsp;</p><p>don't blame your children completely. although i have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you don't need to tolerate that disrespect, try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it. they are acting out their father's agenda, likely because they instinctively see his weakness. children often support the weaker parent, rather than abandon them. you get the worst because they trust your love. but you can still have boundaries. letting them abuse you isn't the answer, but have compassion for their position. this picture isn't their fault, but as adults, they can be held accountable for their choices.</p><p>reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. you don't need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. hold onto the likelihood that some day, they will come back and be grateful. it may take a while, you can't rush it, but they will see you for who you are. your power is in giving them a consistently calm, generous, connected, supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on.&nbsp;</p><p>i'd recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon, or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded. good luck!</p><p><br></p>"}

(but i do want you to be safe...whatever that means to you). maybe talk to someone you trust.&nbsp;</p><p>with each encounter you have with other people (sexual or not), you will learn more about yourself and what you want, both sexually and just in relationship or friendship. you will develop a sense of who you are.</p><p>have you tried to get to know yourself sexually? this is a super place to start, and knowing how your own body works can give you confidence when you eventually connect with others. when you explore your own body, what feels good? what brings you to orgasm?&nbsp;</p><p>i wish you well as you explore both who you are and how it feels to connect with others safely. :)</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i self-harm, and i stop for awhile. then when i see something sad or depressing, i automatically want to self-harm.### Assistant: <p>in a way, self-harm can present somewhat like an addiction. &nbsp;according to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this. &nbsp;when a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm, the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better. &nbsp;if a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety, that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form (addiction) that would utilize this new behavior. &nbsp;another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens, a positive reward for a behavior, even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences. &nbsp;</p><p>consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes, in this case sadness or depression, and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior (such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist) and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior. &nbsp; someone who is trained in dialectic behavior therapy and/or interpersonal neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you.&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: my mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though i'm in my 20s. she argues with me over stupid stuff.### Assistant: <p>this is a common issue. you grow up gradually, and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance. i'm all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom.&nbsp;</p><p>ultimately, you only have control over yourself, so that's the place to start. you can remind yourself that mom's behaviours don't mean that she doesn't trust you or love you; it's just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen year old range. if you can see her responses as habits, rather than a reflection of how she feels about you, then you can keep yourself calm. the more calm you are, the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>take a look at the picture from her perspective. she may feel overwhelmed with finances (are you in college?), and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she doesn't know how to recruit help for. i bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you, cleaning, cooking, doing laundry...all those thankless mom tasks. take a look at how she talks to you... is she nagging about chores? can you see that underneath the nagging there's a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance? &nbsp;okay, so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef. she wants help. you want respect. let's talk about how you get both.</p><p>i propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic. \"mom...i see us as stuck in how we interacted when i was fourteen. can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want?\" sell it as \"win-win\". then you write down some things that end up forming a contract.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.42857;\">the first part is stuff that's your business and your business alone: things you want your mom to respect, like your room, your school, your job, your personal relationships and hygiene.... mom's voice has no place in these arenas, unless you are storing food in your room and it's a health hazard. this is a \"mom says nothing about\" list.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>the second part is about what mom needs from you. what are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult. does she want you to contribute to rent? buy your own food? do your own laundry? what items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of mom? how will these things be enforced? what will happen if you don't follow through? write it all down so it's really clear. it has to all be mutually agreed upon.</p><p>the third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you, and how you talk to her. you can let her know that you don't want to be told what to do or when to do it; that doesn't work when you're 20 years old. listen to what she wants too. beyond the contract you've just written up, anything else you want from each other is a request, it's optional, and whether and when you do it is at your discretion. my guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect, you'd be more willing to help out. and, i think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less. go for the win-win.&nbsp;</p><p>i wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with mom. :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i get angry and act out. it scares my wife and child.### Assistant: <p>anger is a normal emotion, no different than joy, elation, or sadness. it's not anger that gets us in trouble it's the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble. being able to control your temper depends on several variables: how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict, and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations. there are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they don't readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode, and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations, they don't take time to think out situations or to make sense of them, they just impulsively respond. i would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior. in addition, i would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed. the first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing, which you have, now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion, and communicate that you're angry. remember, anger is the overt expression of some other emotion (i.e., disappointment, hurt, frustration, etc..) hope this helps...</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: he isn't violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. he's working on them and has improved. we started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.### Assistant: <p>hello and thank you for your question. i worked for a number of years with people who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive. being involved in a relationship with a partner&nbsp;who does the behaviors&nbsp;you describe can be incredibly difficult, and many would argue is even harder than&nbsp;overcoming actual physical violence. </p><p>i was a little confused about whether you're are still broken up with this person or if you are still thinking about it. i am going to assume you are still undecided. </p><p><br></p><p>some of the things you are describing sound like emotional abuse. even without physical abuse, being emotionally abused can still be traumatizing. when partners question and accuse, they are often trying to exercise power and control over their partners by hurting them with unfounded accusations.&nbsp; the accusations serve to make someone feel guilty&nbsp;and to manipulate them. for example, if your partner accuses you of cheating when you go out bowling with friends, you may elect not to go bowling just to satisfy your partner and prevent a fight from occurring. </p><p>the person being accused or questioned often tries&nbsp;to prove over and over again that they have done nothing wrong, but it doesn't matter. </p><p>and that brings me to the point of what some people&nbsp;who experience these behaviors&nbsp;do in order to start feeling like they have some power again.&nbsp;here are just a few things:</p><p><br></p><p>1. they realize there is no right answer. trying to be logical with someone who doesn't want to be logical doesn't work. many people simply stop trying to defend themselves against false accusations because there was no answer that would satisfy their partner anyway.&nbsp;in addition, the rules of the relationship seem to change on a daily basis, and what may be okay with your partner one day may make them angry the next. and this can leave people constantly feeling like they are on eggshells.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>2.&nbsp;the find support. finding a support group or a group of people who remind you on a daily basis that you are a decent person is always a good idea. one of the things that can happen when we are with someone who does emotionally abusive things&nbsp;is begin to have a negative&nbsp;concept of ourselves. surrounding yourself with people who remind you that you are a good person&nbsp;is a great idea. </p><p><br></p><p>3.&nbsp;they reinvest in themselves. try to find some time for yourself. this couldn't possibly sound more clichã©, but it is actually true. whether that is taking up a new hobby or doing an old one. one thing that can happen when emotional abuse&nbsp;takes place in a relationship&nbsp;is the person&nbsp;being abused can begin to isolate and not do the things that make them enjoy life. taking some time for the self can sometimes bring things into perspective.</p><p>i don't know if you are still in counseling, but if you are and you are getting what you need then that is great. if not, there are others you can try. it's important to find the right fit. </p><p><br></p><p>as for the question of whether or not you should leave your partner, that is a question that can only be answered by you. but you could ask yourself some questions&nbsp; like these to help you decide:</p><p><br></p><p>1. what are some of my values about relationships? do&nbsp;i&nbsp;want trust? honesty? ask yourself if you have these things in your relationship.</p><p>2. do i feel like this relationship brings out the best in me, or does it seem to bring me down?</p><p>3. if i want to stay in this relationship, what are some specific things that need to change? </p><p><br></p><p>hope some of these suggestions help. </p><p><br></p><p>good luck to you. be well.</p><p><br></p><p>robin landwehr, dbh, lpc, ncc </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i blame my past relationship for it. i know it is bad to be this way. i want to get past it.### Assistant: <p>we humans are social beings. we learn how to be in relationship as children. the caregiving you received (or didn't receive) set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you don't matter. there are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure - so congrats on that because clearly you are already there! &nbsp;next i'd suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities, either as a couple or individually.&nbsp;</p>"}

(trust me this is true)...she carries her own burden of shame for what she did. for you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden. it only adds to yours.&nbsp;</p><p>can you find the tender emotion under your anger? you're hurt. validate that hurt. honour that hurt. take care of that hurt. you can stay away from people who disregard your needs, and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life.&nbsp;</p><p>if you continue to struggle, please seek the help of a professional who can assist you in navigating these waters. :)</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me. i really want to stop it and enjoy things.### Assistant: <p>thinking about what others think of us is a natural tendency. human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people, places, and things to let us know more about ourselves. we also have an inner voice, dialogue, conscience, etc. that helps us to determine the path for us. often, when someone is worried about the external feedback, and focuses on this as the sole source of information, it can create a dependency that can become problematic. balance is key to so many things in life. your own voice is powerful and has strength to provide you the enjoyment you seek. don't discount it and rely only on the voices of others.<br></p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i'm a teenager, and i just got my first job. i am a month and a half in. yesterday, my boss pushed me to the point where i had to go to the restroom and cry. she didn't see me, and i'm glad, but when i went to talk to her about it today, i let a tear or two come out. i hate it. i feel like they're not going to keep me anymore.### Assistant: <p>getting your first job is an exciting, terrifying, and challenging experience. it is something you will remember for a long time and it shapes how you begin to think about yourself as a worker. you are literally \"learning as you go\" in this completely new environment. you are going to make mistakes. you are not going to get it right the first time. it can be even more challenging if you are having a difficult time building relationships that are supportive at work. a couple of things to remember here: 1) you are there to do a job and you are getting paid to do it, 2) there is a reason or reasons for you wanting to be there and do that work, 3) you know best what you need in order to be successful. these three items can be helpful to remember, especially when we feel our emotions are taking over in a place where we do not feel safe to express them fully. if you feel like your supervisor is approachable, meaning someone you could talk to because they express confidence in you, let them know you are nervous about doing a good job. also let them know how you learn new tasks, information, or expectations so they can deliver the message in a way that you understand. becoming a successful worker doesn't happen overnight, but each day you can identify what works for you and what doesn't by communicating with your work team, the easier it will be for you. we all had a first job once, and were all worried about doing well. hang in there, and call a counselor if you need more help.<br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: my husband and i are separated. he says he needs some time apart. he says he needs to get back the â€œin loveâ€ part of a relationship but doesnâ€™t want to lose me. should i wait or start over new?### Assistant: <p>it's not uncommon for relationships to go cold over time. it is a matter of one or the other becoming complacent. if you and your husband have been together for quite some time it's likely that you are very comfortable and familiar with each other. while this is a good thing in some ways, it can also become boring and you run the risk of losing that \"in love\" feeling he is referring to. couples simply become ambivalent. </p><p>for some of the couples i work with in my practice, i find that helping to organize a time apart, which i call a \"therapeutic separation\" can do wonders for the relationship. i offer homework to be done during this time. reading, worksheets and individual counseling helps people learn more about themselves and what they desire out of their relationship. it often times brings more appreciation for their partners. when the pair comes back together, we are able to push the reset button and begin a new chapter that is more fulfilling and exciting than before. <br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: in the last ten months, i've been kicked out, moved around three times, worked many jobs, stopped school to make money, had dad and mom get sick, was cheated on while pregnant, lost my baby, had relationship issues, and was betrayed. i can't get a job. i have no friends. i feel lonely and isolated. i've been dealing with all this by myself.### Assistant: <p>one thing that may help is to focus on small things that you do have control over. if you can hold onto that sense of having control over what you wear or what you choose to eat or where you go during the day, this may help you be able to look at what is currently most important for you and consider different choices. for example, you say you can't get a job, but i wonder if you could work with and local agencies to help you find a job, like career link. you say you have no friends currently. are there any previous friends that you can get back in contact with?</p><p>you mentioned that you have no friends. is there anyone in your life that you can talk with, even if it's not someone that you consider a closest friend?</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: my daughter basically freaked out out of nowhere over me saying â€œcalm downâ€ when she dropped her phone. within seconds, the situation escalated to her kicking me out on the curb, saying horrifically unspeakable things, and her calling the cops on me. she seems unable to stop herself at times.### Assistant: <p>bipolar disorder has a lot of different components. if this is a one-time event, it could be that your daughter had an intense moment of anger and the phrase of asking her to \"calm down\" may have made her feel as though you weren't understanding what she was saying. bipolar disorder also includes feelings of depression. when this is coupled with intense anger and acting or speaking without thinking, these can be part of bipolar disorder, but that wouldn't be the whole picture of what bipolar disorder would look like. it may be helpful to track differences that you notice in your daughter's mood and any patterns related to the times of day or what seems to lead her to be upset. patterns are very helpful in figuring out what is happening.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i'm a teenager, and i created a sort of imaginary friend to help me cope with stressful situations or if i'm worried or upset. she \"gives me advice\" and comforts me and tells me it'll be okay. i've given her a name (solace) and created a personality for her that's like a comforting motherly figure. i know it's just my own advice and my own thoughts, but it's just that i'm thinking of them through a voice other than my own. i do this because i know i never really listen to my own advice, and i thought it would be better if it was through someone else who knew my thought process in and out, through this imaginary friend. is this normal? could it develop into a separate personality with time if i continue a mentality that she is her own person?### Assistant: <p>since you are saying that you know that the thoughts are yours and your thinking of them in a different person's voice to make them easier for you to follow through on, it doesn't sound like it could develop into another personality.</p><p>it may be helpful to also find other things that give you comfort and to practice telling yourself that it will be okay in your own voice. if you start to do that slowly, it may be more comfortable for you. if you're following following through with your own advice, it sounds like some part of you knows that you are making choices that you agree with.</p><p>what else gives you comfort? maybe there's a room that you like to be in when you are home or a certain outfit or color that makes you feel good. focusing on these things may also be comforting to you.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i get really mad easily at my parents and family.### Assistant: <p>anger is not necessarily a bad thing. if you are angry and you can talk about your feelings, that would be very helpful. anger usually comes along with something else, like feeling sad, worried, overwhelmed, confused, and many others. consider looking at what you notice in addition to anger and you may have a different starting point. if you get along well with friends and don't get angry with them, look at the differences. do you feel criticized by your parents or family? misunderstood? there could be any number of things.</p><p>i wonder if you start getting angry very slowly and it builds or if it happens quickly. try to keep an eye on the patterns and see if you can stop and look at what else is going on as you start to get angry. anger is a real emotion in itself. it almost always connects to something else as well.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: my fiancã©e is always letting me know how i am a horrible/evil person, or i just donâ€™t care enough when itâ€™s about her feeling or when she is having an off day.### Assistant: <p>one thing you could try is to have a conversation when neither of you is upset so that you learn what makes each of you feel cared for and valued. it could be that you are showing caring in a way that doesn't quite match what she is really looking for in that moment. for example, having an in-depth conversation could be something that you want, but she may just want a hug in that moment.&nbsp;</p><p>i don't know if you heard of gary chapman's book about love languages, but it may be helpful.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i no longer carry expressions on my face, and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiancã©e.### Assistant: <p>sometimes when we fight a lot with our partner, it becomes more uncomfortable to share emotions because it feels like it will lead to another flight or disagreement.</p><p>you could try having a conversation when you're not fighting and starting it out by saying that you would like to discuss something important to you and see if your fiancã©e is open to that.</p><p>something else is that you could have an agreement that if one of you is having a really strong emotions in a difficult conversation and would like to break from the conversation, you could agree (ahead of time) that you'll say that you would like a \"timeout\" and will come back to discuss the issue in a certain amount of time (usually about an hour) and then try to resume the discussion. the reason this can work is it can give you a chance to calm down and then still go back to the discussion rather than not talking about it again. this only works if both of you agree to that before something starts, though.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i know i was molested as a child, but i have no memory of it.### Assistant: <p>i'm not sure that i have the answer to your question, but i can tell you that it would be helpful to talk with a certified hypnotist. there are a list of them here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.natboard.com/index_files/page548.htm\">http://www.natboard.com/index_files/page548.htm</a>. you also may want to talk to someone who specializes in emdr. this stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and it is a specific trauma treatment. i am not trained in this particular method, but my understanding is that it does not require a lot of knowledge of the origin of the trauma before being started.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i think i may suffer from depression, and it is affecting my life and sleep. i am on my parent's insurance, and they won't let me see a therapist because they don't believe in it.### Assistant: <p>the answer here really depends upon your age and something called the \"age of consent\" in the state where you live. in pennsylvania, anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment. as for billing purposes, try talking to some local agencies. if you are under 18, you may be able to have medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment. if you are over 18, there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation you're in. maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agencies.</p><p>if you are in school, you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school. this would not require using your insurance.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: sometimes, when i look at my pet cat, i think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. it makes me sad because i love him, but i always think about how helpless he is. there've even been split-seconds where i felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.### Assistant: <p>a lot of different things could be happening here. do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? if you have not actually kicked him, then i would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. what else is there?</p><p>it would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. it could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i have three siblings. my mom loves them and not me. sheâ€™s always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them. iâ€™m always crying in my room.### Assistant: <p>have you ever tried talking with her about this when she's not angry? while i hear you saying that it feels like she doesn't love you, there could be a lot of other pieces to this. have you ever told her about how much she means to you (when she's not angry)?</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: over the years, i have slowly lost everything: my jobs, my cars, my freedom, and my money. i am a stay-at-home mom who doesn't make any money, doesn't have a car, never goes out, and cleans all day long everyday.### Assistant: <p>there are an infinite number of possibilities here. you included a lot of things that you don't have. is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? a lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. i don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.</p><p>i wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. i don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. i wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? if you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.</p><p>also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. for example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i'm not the same anymore, i don't know how to get back to who i am. i'm sad and confused and angry and tired. i don't sleep well.### Assistant: <p>being tired can really affect almost everyone's ability to work through things that make them sad, confused, or angry, among other emotions. if you're having difficulty sleeping, try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day. also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that it's time to sleep when you are in bed. if you are not sleeping while you are in bed, consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed. hopefully you'll be able to establish a pattern.</p><p>sometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well. try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changes.</p><p>if you're still struggling, consider talking with a therapist about the specifics and/or maybe talking with your primary care physician. there are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i try to do everything right just so we won't argue, and it doesn't help the only time he is calm is when he is drinking alcohol. i get anxiety over having fights with him.### Assistant: <p>because of the way that you say your boyfriend is only calm when he is drinking and you have concerns about flights, it would probably be most helpful for you to speak with a local therapist so you can have specific conversations about what happens during these fights.</p><p>when you do \"everything right,\" are you saying that you don't argue? it sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each other's mind without being able to communicate effectively. i recommend working on this with a therapist, though (even if you end up going without your boyfriend to sessions), so that you can talk about specific strategies and what you can do when he is not calm.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: iâ€™m in my early 20s. my exâ€™s parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me. i left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like i was the bad one.### Assistant: <p>maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future. if you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex, that could be one element of the discussion, but it doesn't have to be.</p><p>i don't know how long we have been together with your current partner, but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time. that may be a discussion to have with them as well.</p><p>hopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: maybe this is a stupid question, but i sometimes don't know what's real or not. if feel at times like everyone's lying. how do i know if god is one of those lies?### Assistant: <p>the way that i see it is that humans have always been afraid of life and death, historically we have always tried to understand life, we try to organize it, categorize it, explore it, and we've built up this system, our system and societies system around us to help us define what life and (death) is, this system or way is not real but only a perception of our own value judgements, it is, no matter how you try to argue it, a false system of conditioning, humans have a finite mind and a finite mind cannot ever hope to understand an infinite mind of which a god would be. god has been developed over time as a security blanket for our child-like selves, the world is a beautifully brutal place and what is more reassuring than a master that will take care of us and show us the way. on earth alone there are thousands of gods and even many more systems of thought, economics, societal structures and so on, it is almost as though it were a supermarket with so many choices, we have more choices in gods than we do flavors of ice cream at baskin-robbins, so then i ask you, \"which one is real?, and \"what is real?\"<br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.### Assistant: <p>something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action.&nbsp;</p><p>some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. the first i'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. try to be very specific, such as \"my palms are feeling very sweaty, and i can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies.\" then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible. &nbsp;combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>if you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then i'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. this professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i start counseling/therapy in a few days (i'm freaking out) but my main fear is that i'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?### Assistant: <p>people do cry in therapy sometimes, but it's not at all necessary to cry in order for most kinds of therapy to be helpful. when you start counseling you don't yet know your counselor very well, so it's normal to keep your feelings in check until you feel comfortable and a bit more relaxed with your counselor and with the situation. sometimes, though, there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear. if you feel safe right away in the situation with your counselor, you might just cry in spite of your fears about it. your therapist is used to people expressing how they feel and will keep strict confidentiality, so even though it's embarrassing, finally experiencing someone truly listening with empathy and kindness may just be worth it. it's okay too to let your counselor know right at the beginning that you're kind of freaked out about getting too emotional in front of another person.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. i was very embarrassed.### Assistant: <p>sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. we know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? if you tune into your own thoughts, or your \"internal dialogue\", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. so people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, \"how could i do that?\", \"i looked so stupid!\" \"now people saw things i did not want them to see!\" if we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. these are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. if you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, \" we all make mistakes\", \"people can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!\" and \"if someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really ok! people have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem.\" when you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.<br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.### Assistant: <div>since it is clear that people react differently to the same&nbsp;stressors, we know that the stressors are not causing the anxiety, <b>our thoughts</b> about the stressors are. often, cognitive distortions are the problem. some common cognitive distortions include catastrophizing (predicting the worst), future telling, black and white thinking (if it's not perfect, it's terrible), mind-reading (i just know he is angry at me) and can't-standitis (i can't stand this situation). there are more, but the list is long, and if some of these are resonating with you, i would advise looking up cbt (cognitive behavioral therapy) tips, worksheets, booklets etc. on line, or contact a local cbt therapist. </div><div><br></div><div>another helpful piece of info on anxiety, is that it is prone to something called \"symptom stress\" - being anxious about anxiety. if we could hear this symptom stress it might sound like, \"oh no i'm getting nervous about this, i'm getting uptight, i look nervous, what if i have a panic attack!\" followed by&nbsp;&nbsp;more cognitive distortions such as \"i can't stand being anxious!\" and \"this is horrible!\"&nbsp;the&nbsp;antidote to this is acceptance.&nbsp; kind of like not stopping the waves but learning to surf instead (jon kabat-zinn). if you happen to feel anxious, say to yourself - this is just a reaction i'm having that is unpleasant, but not horrible. i can tolerate and survive some anxiety, i can breathe deeply,&nbsp;and i'll be ok because panic attacks never killed anyone. i can stand this and it is temporary. you get the idea.</div><div><br></div><div>we can increase our awareness of anxiety-provoking self-talk, and counteract it with calming and reassuring self-talk. we have the ability to think about our thinking, decide which thoughts are healthy and which are unhealthy, and choose which to focus on. we brainwash ourselves with our thinking, and according to self-perception theory, \" we learn what we&nbsp;believe when we hear ourselves speak,\" so we may as well be a calming, reassuring presence in our own minds. :)<br></div>"}

{"text": "### Human: i no longer carry expressions on my face, and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiancã©e.### Assistant: sometimes repressing anger can lead to depression and block all kinds of other emotions too. &nbsp;i would wonder about your experience with anger and if you've ever been discouraged from expressing anger. &nbsp;i would also wonder if you feel like you have space to express yourself in your relationship or if you feel like you really aren't being heard. &nbsp;it's hard to feel cared for and connected to someone else when you don't feel accepted by them."}

{"text": "### Human: i don't feel like myself anymore. for example, i could walk up an entire flight of stairs before realizing that my legs are moving. i feel like iâ€™m watching my life be lived by someone else.### Assistant: you may be experiencing a form of dissociation called depersonalization. &nbsp;people with this type of dissociation may feel disconnected from their bodies, feel that they are watching their bodies from a distance, or may not recognize their image in the mirror. &nbsp;dissociation sometimes occurs after someone experiences something traumatic. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>i would suggest working with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders as dissociation does not typically resolve on its own. &nbsp;on my website, i have some information specific to <a href=\"http://www.sarahmcintyrelpc.com/counseling-for-dissociation-in-houston/\" target=\"_blank\">dissociation</a> that you may find helpful. &nbsp;best of luck to you.</div>"}

{"text": "### Human: i always feel like i'm doing something wrong. everything i do is crappy. i want to cry all the time. i can't eat or sleep.### Assistant: you are describing some of the most common symptoms of depression: low self esteem, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, sad mood, feelings of hopeless and feelings of worthlessness. a full assessment/evaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a major depressive disorder i.e.., are delressed. one thing i often tell patients is that \"do you think you are depressed?\" people often answer yes or no, but many individuals respond with a question: how would i know? to that i often explain that if i stopped watching movies or better, stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that i am delressed. it would be a sign that i have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that i typically enjoy most . i'll ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy. &nbsp;it could be anything from reading, to being with friends, to skiing to watching tv. &nbsp;i would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or can't find the motivation to engage in it? this is another symptom of depression: loss in pleasurable activities. the good news is that there are many effective, available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply, you want to modify/decrease your depressive symptoms i.e., you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless. treatment includes one or more of the following: psychotherapy, medication, exercise. any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood. the even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time. &nbsp;i hope you find this information helpful. the most important next step is to get evaluated by a mental health professional typically a psychologist or psychiatrist, and for both you and the professional to better understand your symptoms and your mood in the context of what is going on in your life."}

{"text": "### Human: i am a really shy person. i'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. how can i get more confident?### Assistant: <p>a good way to start is the language or \"self talk\" that is happening inside your mind. &nbsp;looking at your question, when it is said that the presentations \"make me feel stress\" you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self. &nbsp;the presentations cannot give or take away your stress, that's something only you can do and you can do it! &nbsp; what language can you change in your self talk? &nbsp;for example, are you saying \"i can't speak in front of an audience! i'll fail?\" &nbsp;that sounds a lot different than \"i studied my butt off and if i practice speaking out loud, i can ace this presentation!\" &nbsp;although this is a short answer, i do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: why am i so afraid of it? i don't understand.### Assistant: <p>why are you afraid of rape? because it is a problem in the united states! the national sexual violence resource center reports that one in five women (0r 20%) will be raped (http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf) and that 80% of women know their assailant. given these statistics, it is perfectly logical to be afraid. however, there are things you can do to reduce the risk of rape, such as being aware of your surroundings, and limiting the use of drugs or alcohol.</p><p>the enhanced access, knowledge, act program for college-aged women has been shown to reduce the risk of rape by more than 50%. (http://www.blueprintsprograms.com/factsheet/eaaa-enhanced-assess-acknowledge-act-sexual-assault-resistance-education) you may want to see if a program like this is available in your area.&nbsp;</p><p>another great app for when you need to walk somewhere alone, is the companion app (http://www.companionapp.io). friends or family can track your progress from one point to another via the gps in your phone.</p><p>in addition, talking with a counselor about your fears would also be a good idea. sometimes fears are rational and reasonable. sometimes they are over-reactions and unreasonable. when then are over-reactions and unreasonable, they can have a negative impact on your life. in this case, a counselor could help you understand why your fears are unreasonable, and how you can stop them from negatively impacting your life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i'm having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her. how can i learn how to listen and get myself together?### Assistant: <p>the first step for making this sort of change is being motivated to change and it sounds like you have that, so you are already on the right track.</p><p>as far as learning how to listen, try some of these steps:</p><ul><li>ask whether a certain time is a good time for your girlfriend to have an important conversation</li><li>if she has a subject that she would like to discuss, consider listening to her as an investigative reporter and asking questions that help you to gain more understanding of her experience. these questions usually begin with words like who, what, where, when. questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way. you can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your girlfriend is saying and have her agree that you are recapturing the essence of what she is trying to communicate</li><li>then you can switch so she is listening to you trying to understand your experience. you could also start by talking about something that is important to you.</li><li>remember that stating that you follow or hear something that she is saying doesn't mean that you agree</li><li>also, try sticking to one subject at a time. it's difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or two</li><li>try to use the word want or wish instead of need. saying that you need something (or if your girlfriend would say that) that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation. that takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or try to change</li></ul><p>something else to try would be using some sort of timeout. consider this:</p><ul><li>discuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts. timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five, 10, 15 minutes, or maybe even an hour. when there are a lot of emotions happening, each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceiving.</li><li>when using timeout, say to your girlfriend (or she can say to you) \"i need an hour before we can go back to this.\" then actually come back to the discussion.</li><li>some people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way. this is why the agreement is important before you need it.</li></ul><p>while it may be helpful to ask your girlfriend what it is she may want from you, it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practice.</p><p>try to remember that part of being in a couple is holding onto your own wants, wishes, and desires while recognizing those of your partner.</p><p>as one final idea, consider spending about 15 minutes a week together where you are not problem-solving about anything, just connecting with one another.</p><p>i encourage you to see a therapist who specializes in couples if you would like some more specific ideas for what is happening within each of you and between you.</p><p>best wishes!</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i'm having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her. how can i learn how to listen and get myself together?### Assistant: <p>the best tool for becoming a better listener that i know of is called imago dialogue. it consists of 3 steps:</p><p>1. mirroring what she says (without judging, commenting, refuting, defending, arguing, or scoffing--just listening, no matter the content) and repeating it back, word-for-word. continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesn't.</p><p>2. validating. you tell her you you understanding why she feels this way. (if you don't understand, then find a way.) you can also say, \"that makes sense\" or \"i hear you\" or \"i get that.\"</p><p>3. empathizing. tell her how you think she must feel about what she's telling you. your job is to try and feel what it feels like to be her.</p><p>this is a very different way of communicating than we're used to. my guess is that the arguments, discussions, and debates you've had with her have been counterproductive because you're both trying to win. with imago dialogue, you both win. she gets to be heard and you get to hear for a change.</p><p>at the end of the exercise, switch roles. for more info:&nbsp;http://imagorelationships.org/pub/about-imago-therapy/imago-dialogue-101/</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: my wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that i'm doing things she finds disrespectful even when i don't mean it like that. for example, she gets offended when i call someone at work \"sweetheart.\"  i wish i had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her.  she doesn't, and never will say she was wrong. how do i get her to understand?### Assistant: hello. that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story, i would say that you are raising 3 different concerns.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. it may bear clarifying how each of you define \"infidelity\". currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. if there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, \"i feel you distancing from me.\" in other words, it's not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. if so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. if this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>the second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a \"sweetheart.\" the term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean \"you're so sweet and kind\", \"my dear\", or in a flirtatious manner to mean \"sweetie.\" the intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. you may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. if your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said. &nbsp;if she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, \"i want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that i am not valued as much.\" therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? you may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? is saying \"sweetheart\" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? that said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. she may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.</div><div><br></div><div>the last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she's wrong. indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. in the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. this pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. this kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. we sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, \"i'm sorry.\" however, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. in my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says \"i'm sorry\", i am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. if neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn't do it.? these insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>for more information about these services, you are welcome to read my materials on my website at www.psychologyresource.ca or to contact me at (514) 690-2469.</div><div><br></div>"}

{"text": "### Human: we weren't long distance until he joined the military.  i love him and i know he loves, me but it's complicated. he said he's not going to find someone else, but i'm afraid. how do i keep our relationship going?### Assistant: <p>hello. you are asking a very good question about how to sustain a long-distance relationship. although maintaining a long-distance relationship has its challenges, with the proper communication, commitment, and understanding, many long-distance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection.&nbsp;</p><p>without knowing more about the \"complicated\" nature of your relationship, i wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else. has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him? &nbsp;or, is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter, you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. the more you focus on \"what if\" situations, the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure.&nbsp;</p><p>however, if there is reason for you to question his fidelity, you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a long-distance relationship. to help the conversation, you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust. is that you wish him to contact you regularly, or to include you more in his life, or to make a clear commitment? for many of my clients in my private practice, that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text, phone, and skype. it's hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and it's hard to build a relationship when you don't know what's going on in your partner's life. other times, it is making sure they talk often to their long-distance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence.. regular communication, understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship, but this is especially true for long-distance ones.&nbsp;</p><p>dr. virginia chow</p><p>www.psychologyresource.ca</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: my girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. she told me that she wants to move. what can i do to help her?  i want her to stay.### Assistant: <p>you're probably not going to like my answer.</p><p>your question says a lot about what you want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what you want.</p><p>addictions don't happen in a vacuum. if you've had any experience with addicts at all, then i'm sure you've heard the term \"enabler\". a lot of the times, when people think they're \"helping\", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.</p><p>you said she recently quit. you said she is depressed. she wants to move. when a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. they need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. it means moving to new locations. anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out why they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. she may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.</p><p>don't pressure her to stay. let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. if she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. it doesn't need to be made under pressure. that will only lead to resentment. support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. let her go. it sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. it wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it, but i don't know how. what can i do?### Assistant: <p>biologically, fear is designed to protect us from harm. fear is not always a bad thing, and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>a phobia, however, is different. you used the term \"fear\" rather than \"phobia\". a phobia is an irrational fear - meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing. if your situation is a phobia, exposure therapy can help. this consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of. some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it. someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges. people who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead, which may not always be feasible. if overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life, then by all means, seek professional help to overcome it.</p><p>everyone has fears, or things that make them nervous. public speaking, asking a person out, fear of failure. examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear. when you can get to the root cause of the fear, you can deal with that issue. a lot of times, it is a self-esteem issue. you may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out what's causing it and deal with the real issue.&nbsp;</p><p>some fears are caused by trauma. someone with ptsd is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into \"fight or flight\" mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldn't notice or react to. in cases like this, exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse. if there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear, i strongly urge you to seek a therapist - not just any therapist, but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes. how can i start accepting myself and be more confident?### Assistant: <p>the answer would require a more in-depth knowledge of you and your situation.&nbsp;</p><p>a lot of times, these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way. you internalize it and accept it as your reality.&nbsp;</p><p>the first step is to evaluate the people close to you, especially your parents. even if you are an adult, think back to your childhood. children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems. the obvious, such as being abused, can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem, but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a person.</p><p>you may have never been physically or sexually abused, but what about emotionally? were you yelled at, berated, put down? were you told you'd never amount to anything? were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short, couldn't live up to expectations? when you hear something over and over again, you start to believe it.</p><p>maybe you weren't yelled at. maybe it was the opposite. studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect. a chronically depressed mother, for example, may have seemed cold, detached, emotionless. she may have been less likely to show interest in a child's life, not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances.&nbsp;</p><p>if one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up, chances are, a lot of the attention went to them, which could have led to your needs not being met.</p><p>any of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant, unheard, unloved, or like they don't matter.</p><p>maybe nothing i've described here fits your situation. if you can't pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own, a counselor can help.</p><p>i am not saying \"blame it on your parents\" or telling you there's nothing you can do to change it! quite the opposite! understanding why you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better. cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition - figure out the why. then behavior - the how.&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it, but i don't know how. what can i do?### Assistant: <p>fears are not that difficult to deal with, first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy, once you are able to employ that in your daily life, you then need to start facing your fear, for instance i'll use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge. we would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie batman begins, bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said \"i'm scared of snakes\", i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattan</p><p>hope that helps <br></p><p>c<br></p>"}

&nbsp;once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions. &nbsp;</p><p>first, if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the \"long haul\", so to speak...and you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again, that is completely do-able and possible if you both put in the work. &nbsp;but, there's a greater issue here that needs to be addressed. &nbsp;you say your relationship is \"good\", but there's been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core. &nbsp;would you agree with that, or what are your thoughts? &nbsp;were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives? &nbsp;if you are more of an emotional person than he is, you may have been less interested sexually because he hasn't been meeting your emotional needs. &nbsp;for instance, if you hadn't been feeling loved, cared about, validated, appreciated, cherished, and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested. &nbsp;this is a common issue with couples, and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations. &nbsp;in essence, many women tend to have more emotional needs than men, this is the way we are hard-wired, and there are exceptions to this of course, but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and normal! &nbsp;until he understands this, and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally, you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally (and sexually). &nbsp;this leads to you both being frustrated, but if all this is ringing true to you, he seriously probably has no clue what's going on and may not know how you're feeling. &nbsp;you need to communicate your needs to him; if you are super lost with how to do that, there's an awesome book called the five love languages. &nbsp;it's not that long, and it's very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships. invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening; really!!</p><p>this is a long post, i'm sorry! &nbsp;but this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it. &nbsp;so back to the second direction you can go....you feel very betrayed, you aren't sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this. &nbsp;for instance, if he says he is working late, or if he doesn't call or text right away when he usually does, you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again. &nbsp;of course, it may not be true, he may have legit reasons for his behaviors, but the point is if you are going to be in paranoia-mode or you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you, then the trust may not be able to be re-built. &nbsp;you need to think long and hard about this, and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty, then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back. &nbsp;you can't just tell him vaguely \"i need to trust you again\"; if he wants his family back and he's willing to do the work, you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it. &nbsp;but, be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you weren't attracted to him anymore (or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you weren't meeting his physical needs)...if he throws that out there, but you weren't showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally, then it all starts with you communicating that to him. &nbsp;get that book!</p><p>in conclusion, if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if he's cheating when his behavior isn't spot on, you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache. &nbsp;there is certainly a way to work through this, but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place. &nbsp;rebuilding trust can be a long process, maybe even years, and for some people, they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past. &nbsp;i truly recommend starting with the book, and then going from there. &nbsp;if you decide you want to stay with him, you would really benefit from couples counseling, as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather.  how can i fight this?### Assistant: <p>seasonal affective disorder (s.a.d.) is a term that reflects how many people are affected by the changing seasons, especially fall to winter. &nbsp;everyone suffers with some form of this (lessened activity levels, increased isolation, etc.) while some find that this time of year can put them into a deeper depression. if you have noticed that this happens frequently, there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward:</p><p>1. attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood. &nbsp;it's important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools.&nbsp;</p><p>2. push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities. it's easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months, when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day, but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly. &nbsp;perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights, complete with hot chocolate and a fire?</p><p>3. you may want to consider the purchase of a s.a.d. light. &nbsp;these are lights that expose you to additional ultra violet light to increase the vitamin d in our bodies, as well as the release of growth hormone (which releases when we wake up). there are mixed reviews of these products, however, and they can be expensive.&nbsp;</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: my depression has been reoccurring for a long time. it all started when i was being bullied in high school. in ninth grade, my principal told me i needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. i needed professional help for my stress because i was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. after that, i was fine for a couple of years. i entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. i believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. i began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. obviously, that wasn't the right choice. i regret ever doing that, seeing as even though i'm not self-harming anymore, i always look back at that time whenever i feel very stressed. i have a big problem with handling problems in life. whenever a problem arises, i get stressed and i feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. i get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. i have a hard time coping with stress because i know that if i could handle it easily then i wouldn't be sad all the time, and i would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.### Assistant: <p>i couldn't help but notice that you did not specify your age, so i am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way, but i want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own. &nbsp;unfortunately, it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful, but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm.&nbsp;</p><p>from what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage. &nbsp;often, when i am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress. &nbsp;when we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper \"rules for success\", it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>stress management is just that, management; of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. each of these aspects requires a separate sets of \"tools\" to manage them accordingly. for example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. for example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity? &nbsp;is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?</p><p>try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: does counseling really do anything that can help people?### Assistant: <p>counseling allows us to have a sacred space, a space that is set apart from the outside world, it is a space of non-judgement and exploration. being that the universe is not made for us and that the the world tends to be a fairly untamed place at times, this sacred space allows us to explore ourselves. it allows for greater reflection upon our attitudes, our behaviors and our feelings. imagine if you will a small goldfish swimming around the usual fish tank, although i dont attest to know what a goldfish thinks, i would imagine he does not see the world outside of him, he only sees the small fishbowl, oblivious to the outside world, when one comes into the counseling room, one is trying to gain insight that was not previously there. remember the observer affect, one cannot truly act objectively with the world, we are in a dynamic relationship with life, it reacts to us and we to it, the time in the counseling room allows us to gain an understanding that is beyond the normal limits, allowing us to see what was before hidden, often times in plain sight.<br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i have ptsd. the side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships.  i even lost my job month ago. \n\nhow can i get my life back?### Assistant: <p>hi there,&nbsp;</p><p>i hear you, ptsd has a very&nbsp;debilitating effect on your whole life. i know that from personal experience. recovering from it is possible and doable!&nbsp;</p><p>first is step is to acknowledge to yourself that your ptsd symptoms are a normal reaction to an abnormal and traumatic event. the nightmares, the anxiety, the heightened startle response - are all typical human responses following exposure to a frightening event. it's important that you don't blame yourself or your body for reacting this way, rather approach yourself with&nbsp;compassion&nbsp;and kindness that you would extend a&nbsp;friend&nbsp;who is hurting.&nbsp;</p><p>the second&nbsp;step is to start taking steps towards healing. i would really encourage you to see a counselor or therapist specializing in trauma recovery so that you have a guided, step by step support. but if this is not an option, you can begin your healing on your own using a step-by-step approach outlined in the book,<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/healing-trauma-pioneering-program-restoring/dp/159179658x\"> healing trauma, by peter levin</a>. it's a very hands-on book and even comes with a cd audio guide. it has concrete exercises that you can do to help you eliminate dissociation, feel grounded, and decrease your anxiety response. i have used myself and with my clients with great success!&nbsp;</p><p>you can begin your recovery journey now with this video with peter levin's approach to trauma recovery:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmjdkzdmllc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmjdkzdmllc</a></p><p>one last thing, i suggest consulting with a nutritionist or a doctor to help you boost your healing with supplements, vitamins, and minerals. the stress from ptsd is very draining on the body, and you use up a lot of energy and resources, so at times of trauma supplements are quite necessary for recovery (magnesium, omega 3, zinc, vitamin c....etc)</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. everything is a constant reminder.  how do i move on?### Assistant: <p>hi,&nbsp;</p><p>break ups can be very devastating and even traumatic. recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time. it's important that you don't compare yourself to others. each and every person will experience this grieving process differently. here are a few tips to help with your recovery:&nbsp;</p><p>1. make sure you surround yourself with people who love you and support you, friends and family. even though you might feel like being alone, make an effort to be around them.&nbsp;</p><p>2. although you might not feel like it, try to take care of yourself as much as possible: eat healthily, get regular sleep, &amp; vigorous or gentle exercise (depending on your mood). the last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick (e.g. flu) is to take care of ourselves even thought that's what we need the most. but when we do get that chicken broth, sleep and vitamins we recover much faster and with less discomfort. that's exactly the same when it comes to emotional&nbsp;pain. take care of yourself, keep&nbsp;yourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster.&nbsp;</p><p>3. as much as possible, put away reminders of the relationship. you might not be ready to throw things out, but try to put them away in a box in the storage or in a closet. and also block social media reminders. there is a lot of wisdom in the saying \"out of sight, out of mind.\"&nbsp;</p><p>4. once the initial shock and intensity of the break up wear off, try out something new. in a relationship, we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try. now it's time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new.&nbsp;</p><p>5. if possible, change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself. changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts, mindset&nbsp;and forget your ex even if just for a few hours. even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders.&nbsp;</p><p>6. in addition, to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong, i would highly recommend seeing a professional counsellor or therapist.&nbsp;</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky.  is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?### Assistant: <p>\"normal\" can be an insidious word to use because it can undermine your sense of worth. &nbsp;it implies there's one particular way you should be behaving and can leave you feeling crappy and \"abnormal\" if you're not behaving according to that prescribed standard. &nbsp;</p><p>instead, what i'd recommend is to pay attention to your emotional experiences when you're attending therapy. &nbsp;explore your feelings and thoughts without judgement and try to reflect and understand what's going on that's causing you anxiety. &nbsp;once you figure out the underlying meaning of the anxiety, you can figure out a way to handle it and action steps to take to diminish it. &nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i'm always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me. \n\nhow do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?### Assistant: <p>it's hard when you feel as if you're the only one that's taking the time to listen to your spouse. but, i would look at this as an opportunity to see if you can become aware of what exactly is happening between you, when you try and talk with your husband.&nbsp;</p><p>sometimes, it can be in the way dialogue is approached. i would suggest paying attention to the way you begin dialogue with your husband. see if blame and criticism are present. when blame and criticism are included, bids for connection, can quickly go off track. this can sometimes start off with something like: \"why don't you...\" \"you aren't...\" \"you don't...\" partners can quickly go into defensive mode if they feel they are being attacked and sometimes starting off like this can feel like an attack. &nbsp;</p><p>also, become aware of the time of day or evening when you approach your husband. sometimes, this can make a big difference for couples as far as when they can truly be present for one another. &nbsp;</p><p>if you find this pattern continues, you might consider seeking professional help through couples therapy. a trained couples therapist can help you both understand more about what's happening between you.&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. everything is a constant reminder.  how do i move on?### Assistant: <p>dealing with a breakup is difficult. we have high hopes and then those hopes and dreams are dashed and we feel at a loss for how to deal with this sudden change in our lives. first, it is important to acknowledge that losing a relationship is a loss and we need to grieve that loss. if we don't allow ourselves time to process and move through the grieving process, we may remain stuck and it may make it hard to move on. so in some ways, you don't want to move on too soon by just trying to ignore your feelings. instead, take good care of yourself, talk to friends and give your self time to heal. the second most important thing is to forgive yourself; this is also an important part of taking care of yourself. you might be blaming yourself and re-living moments when you wish you would have done things differently. by replaying those thoughts you remain stuck. when we begin to forgive ourselves, we truly begin to heal. lastly, in my experience the people who have the most difficulty moving on have not really severed all ties with their ex. they are still following them on social media or even checking in with texts. this is probably the hardest part for some people, but to move forward there needs to be a clear boundary and a clear ending. if you have a clear ending, you can have a new beginning. i hope this helps. take good care of yourself!&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i've only been married three months. every week, we argue about something, and it seems to be getting worse.### Assistant: <p>one key factor to consider is, are you able to repair after your arguments? it seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument. when couples are able to repair after an argument, they have an opportunity to learn more about each other's needs moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p>i'm also curious if you're having the same type of arguments over and over? if you're stuck in a particular pattern, and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens, then you can start to name it. once you name it, then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down (about 30 minutes). the key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place - <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">when things are good between you</span> - an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated, you'll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you don't want to continue this cycle, and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time. that way, when this is enacted during an argument, nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time. rather, both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs.&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i'm always listening to my husband, but it feels like he never listens to me. \n\nhow do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time?### Assistant: <p>thanks for reaching out. this is a great question. communication is definitely a 2-way street. one person cannot participate in a discussion. it takes a talker and a listener. furthermore, communication will breakdown if each party is only focusing on his or her agenda and is not open to what the other person is saying. &nbsp;since i can't ask you questions about what is going on, i am going to make a guess at one situation that comes up a lot when i work with couples. one person focuses more on solving the issue, than listening to their partner. &nbsp;this can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be \"heard.\"</p><p>i understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you. that can be really frustrating and difficult and i want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationship.</p><p>one of the best strategies to gettting heard, is actually to be a good listener to someone else. i know you are probably already a good listener and for you to work on listening skills may seem counterintuitive, right? you want to get heard and now you are the one doing the listening. but this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to and then you can even teach him some of those skills. in other words, you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later on.&nbsp;</p><p>here are some skills for you to use consciously and then you can teach:</p><ul><li>pay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation. no texting or distractions. lean in. focus.</li><li>listen for content and for emotion. clarify what you don't understand. try to understand the person's underlying emotions.&nbsp;</li><li>don't rush to judgement or to changing what is going on with the person. sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going on.&nbsp;</li><li>encourage the other person to continue speaking, nod and vocalize that you hear what they are saying.</li><li>ask questions to get to understand the other person's point of view.<br></li></ul><div>i believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills, and the other person feels heard, they will be more likely to listen to us. if you don't find that this doesn't spill over in that way, then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better. then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it. if there is push back from him, set up a trial period to just try the skill, perhaps for 2 weeks and see if it helps. if communication is really breaking down, then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skills.<br></div><div><br></div><div>best of luck to you!</div>"}

{"text": "### Human: people who are parental figures in my life have, in the past, hurt me, and some continue to do so. it makes me feel like i'm not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me. i have had jobs, but i am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong. any time i bring these things up, i am expected to be over the issue. these are people that you can't just cut out, but i have never received apologies for so much of my pain. i don't know what to do any more. i don't know who i am anymore.### Assistant: <p>hello. adults who come from abusive home histories (physical, emotional, or even psychological), may take a long time to heal from that abuse. we carry our past with us everywhere we go, and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts. this is often easier said than done, but it is possible. from the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns, it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now, that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years. some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed. we have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting, by recognizing that those who hurt us - however they did, might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed.&nbsp;</p><p>those who have directly hurt you, may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions - even in the worst of cases. they themselves may be doing what they can, either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions, to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before. how are they behaving toward you now? can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you? forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves, and isn't dependent on an apology from an offender. by forgiving (even in the absence of any apology), we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us. sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process. talking with someone who can be non-judgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now. seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier, than trying to go it alone. i would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey, so that you can begin a path toward healing.<br></p><p>warm regards,</p><p>shawn berthel, m.s., lmhc<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky.  is this normal? should i still be feeling like this?### Assistant: therapy can feel very weird to begin with - think about it, how often do we go and tell a relative stranger our deepest, darkest thoughts in the rest of our life? so i think its reasonable to expect a certain level of nerves as you get used to your therapist and to the whole process of talking about yourself and vulnerable topics. that said, its definitely worth bringing to the attention of your therapist (if you haven't already) to see if there is anything that they can do, or that the two of you can explore together, that might make the process feel less intimidating to you."}

{"text": "### Human: i need help knowing how to deal with stress. what can i do?### Assistant: our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly, increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles - so one thing that i find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that, which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed. so that means, taking slower, fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles. check out meditation apps such as 'breathe', which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise. i recommend using the app daily, whether you feel stressed or not, and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress - that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calm(wish) and it'll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard."}

{"text": "### Human: does counseling really do anything that can help people?### Assistant: <p>hello. yes, counseling can be beneficial to many people. one of the effective components to effective therapy, is when the client becomes willing to participate in the counseling. i don't mean just show up and listen to the counselor for 45-50 minutes, but also that the client themselves opens up and shares with the counselor the issues that brought them to counseling in the first place. this requires you to be vulnerable, capable of moving past your protective measures of showing the best of yourself, and allowing the counselor to see the sides of you that likely are not as favorable. therapy works when you and the counselor engage openly, honestly, and with mutual trust that both of you will work for common goals - your improvement of self. it does take time, and there are no quick fixes (usually), so be prepared to invest in yourself and explore the dark places. you'll thank yourself later, knowing that you are more connected to yourself and might even feel more whole after the process. be well.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?### Assistant: <p>there are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision. here are a few examples.&nbsp;</p><p>the counselor may determine that the client's needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with. a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed, it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue. if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor, the counselor should look for alternatives, the most common of which would be to terminate and refer. beyond clinical issues, this could also come up around particular other related facts, such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues. this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the client's issues.&nbsp;</p><p>another reason for discharge (and possible referral) would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit. no counselor is the right person to work with everyone. if the right level of connection is not happening, the counselor will often look first at what they are doing, might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things don't seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work. a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations, not doing any agreed on work between sessions, showing up late or being really guarded in session.&nbsp;</p><p>the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on. while this is the easiest one to determine, it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end. however, counselors know that this is part of the process. they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end. this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into.&nbsp;</p><p>all of these (and other) situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending, to monitoring how things are going, then engaging in self reflection, possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor &nbsp;follows through.&nbsp;</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?### Assistant: <p>this is a question that is very specific to each person. there are definitely some variables, but i can give you some general ideas for when counseling might end:</p><ul><li>when a client has met all of their goals, at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselor</li><li>sometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain time</li><li>sometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication. this depends on agency policy, but sometimes it is a requirement. if the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician, frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatly</li></ul><p>i'm not sure why you are asking this question, but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment. oftentimes \"discharge goals\" change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients, their goals, changes in their goals, and many other things. changes are normal, but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind, at least generally, from the beginning. i strongly encourage you to ask about it!</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?### Assistant: <p>hello. the end of the counselor/client relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement. counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons. among them are the client's inability to make forward progress in therapy; the clinician's inability to help the client (for a variety of reasons); a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided; or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere. in this last case, a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the client's inability to pay. that is traditionally seen as an unethical practice. other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client, which in itself should be paramount.</p><p>when the client and therapist decide that services are done, it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur, and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client (and vicariously to the clinician as well, those this is perhaps not as important). this transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journey...rather than some abrupt departure from it. (an abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist). sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed, in which there is a mutually known (albeit perhaps approximate) date of when that program will be finished. in this case, the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy, to a place of healing, growth and situational resolution.</p><p>i have always worked in therapy with the following slogan (if you will), that i learned years ago during graduate school: \"not every therapist is good for every client, and not every client is good for every therapist.\" it is perhaps one of the most important guiding views i hold in working with clients. the therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality - the desire of the client to get better at living life, and the therapist's desire to truly see the client heal and grow. when there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring, the relationship that should be established may not be able to form. or, if already formed, may at some point be unable to move forward. in these instances, referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate. usually, this can be seen pretty quickly by either party, though sometimes it is not always clear.</p><p>ultimately, the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client (which is paramount) are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor, or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere. if both are observant in this process, they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set. eventually, therapy will end, but hopefully based on the client's successful journey to the place where they wanted to go, and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: how does a person start the counseling process?### Assistant: <p>hello. counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist. there is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences, where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help. that said, clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover, or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near future...what they are able to pay for out of pocket. that first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture, but it doesn't have to stay that way. counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients, and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way. the counselor you select should be compassionate, caring, able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns, and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth.</p><p>once you have found a counselor you want to work with, you would then schedule an appointment to meet. that first session is often very low key. there might be some forms for you to complete, which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you. the counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement. this document (which may be several pages long) usually outlines the counselor's credentials; practice rules; forms of payment; office hours; emergency contact details; and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law, among other details. all of this benefits you as the client, so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor.</p><p>in the first session, it is absolutely okay to be nervous. here's a really big secret (which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins): counselors are often as nervous (if not more) to meet a new client, as the client is to meet their new counselor. it's true. we as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills. while simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too, and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us. what makes it even more challenging, is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients (all while we as counselors tend to look at it like we're standing on a three legged stool). this is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client. counselors and clients are both human, and we both make mistakes. coming from that place of understanding, might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together.&nbsp;</p><p>part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors, is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers. we honestly do not, plain and simple. counselors come from life experiences (where they might be farther down on life's road than you); they hold completion of various forms of training; and have advanced education. yet we are in the end, imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people. this makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return. very often, we can find ourselves reflected in our clients' lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life. so as you begin to seek out a therapist, try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too. someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment. that counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength, and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). a while back (3 years ago), i asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. i caught him one night drinking behind my back. i confronted him and he lied, but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but i noticed it was every single night. i didn't like this. for our new yearâ€™s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. he was on boardâ€”no more drinking every night.\nthe other night, i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. it took a couple of days, but tonight, i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but i couldn't wait). i asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and i cannot sleepâ€”it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). he slurred a bit and said no. i asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. i went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch. \ni'm not sure if i'm overreacting or not. i just feel like i'm so honest with him about everything, and i expect the same honesty. he is a good husband in every other regard.### Assistant: <p>it can be very frustrating being lied to. &nbsp;the one thing that struck me was the sentence he had a alcohol addiction \"in the past.\" &nbsp;addiction is not something that comes and goes. &nbsp;once you have addict tendencies they are here to stay. &nbsp;you may be able to fight them off for awhile but the will enviably rear their ugly head again. &nbsp;some of the things that we would suggest is taking the access away. &nbsp;if the alcohol is not conveniently in the house he would have to go seek it out elsewhere. &nbsp;you can think about it in other terms. &nbsp;if chocolate cake was your favorite food and you were a diabetic, you would not have chocolate cake lying around all the time because you know you would eventually eat it. &nbsp;remember there are no temporary addicts.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i have bipolar ii disorder, i'm addicted to alcohol and weed, and i'm hopeless. i keep drinking even though it's harming myself and others.### Assistant: <p>you are not hopeless, as you can see there are many people who care about your well being and believe you can overcome this. &nbsp;i would suggest that you first get evaluated for your alcohol consumption. &nbsp;alcohol is one of the addictions that you may need to seek inpatient treatment for. &nbsp;if not inpatient then be monitored by a doctor. &nbsp;once you are evaluated and or complete inpatient treatment i would suggest you participate in a form of outpatient therapy on a consistent basis. &nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: or how to send him somewhere that can help him, something like the baker act.### Assistant: <p>your dad needs to be aware that he has a problem and be willing to make some changes in order for him to be motivated to stop. &nbsp;often times individuals will be forced to stop when they were not ready. &nbsp;remember we can not ever make someone do something they do not want to do. &nbsp;there needs to be at least a little willingness on the other party to make some changes. &nbsp;i would encourage you to reach out to your family or other loved ones and have a conversation with your dad regarding your concerns.&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: after first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?### Assistant: <p>a good therapist will discuss what brought you to therapy in the first place and devise a therapy plan with you on some of the things that you may want to work on. &nbsp;the plan is not set in stone as things may arise during your therapy sessions. you also agree on how often and when you would like to meet.&nbsp;</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?### Assistant: <p>in the best case scenario, it's a mutual discussion and decision. if not, &nbsp;i've had the discussion initiated both ways, by me, when i sense the client has gone has far as they want, by lack of interest in accepting or completing homework assignments, missing or cancelling appointments, usually at the last minute, lack of participation during sessions. &nbsp;client initiates by asking me pointed questions about why the need for homework assignments,, by forgetting their calendar, or their checkbook :) , by suggesting that we make appointments over longer intervals (once a week to once a month, for example). &nbsp;i rarely have had to terminate a working relationship--that's why i don't charge for the first visit, so we know if we are a good fit before we start working together. &nbsp;then i periodically ask whether the client feels we are making progress, moving in the right direction, talking about the most relevant issues etc.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?### Assistant: <p>counseling ends when the client has received the maximum benefit from the therapist. even if the therapist believes the client is not making progress, the client may feel they are improving and receiving a benefit. and the therapist may see a benefit and the client does not. it is best to have ongoing dialogue with the client to determine when termination is appropriate.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?### Assistant: <p>there are several reasons for a counselor to decide to end counseling. &nbsp;a major reason to end counseling is if the counselor feels that he or she does not have the skills or experience to work with the client. &nbsp;this may happen during the intake process or after working with the client for some time. &nbsp;if the clinician feels that the client is not benefitting from the therapy, it is ethical to suggest that the client terminate the therapy. &nbsp;the process of termination must not injure the client and, if necessary, the clinician may need to refer the client to other treatment modalities. &nbsp;another reason to terminate working with a client is if the client needs a higher level of care. &nbsp;if the client has a crisis or is at risk of hurting himself or someone else, he or she may need a higher level of care. &nbsp;in this circumstance, the clinician may need to involve outside services such as a crisis unit. &nbsp;a third reason to terminate with a client is if the clinician feels that he or she cannot remain professional with the client relationship. &nbsp;for example, if the issues that the client is working on bring up something significant for the clinician and the clinician feels that he is unable to separate that from the professional relationship. &nbsp;in this instance, the clinician should refer the client to another therapist. &nbsp;finally, if the client has reached her goals for therapy and no longer needs treatment, the clinician and client should terminate treatment.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: what are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client?### Assistant: <p>each counselor will have their own list of \"difficulties\" in doing therapy work with a client. &nbsp;even if clinically trained similarly, since counselors are human then their response to your question will reflect their unique differences as humans.</p><p>on my list is when the emotional pain i feel for someone describing some type of injustice or unfair treatment by another, feels very deep.</p><p>sometimes i feel like avoiding the pain i feel by asking questions which will steer the conversation away from the painful areas the client talks about.</p><p>what in fact is necessary to clear out their pain, is to step further into so as to realize their emotional pain isn't greater than who they are.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: does counseling really do anything that can help people?### Assistant: <p>yes, counseling can help people.</p><p>how this happens is bc the counselor can guide the person or couple into deeper areas of their thoughts and emotions than the person or partners would typically avoid or not even realize they are avoiding.</p><p>also, a counseling session offers emotional safety because the therapist will intervene with thoughtful questions if someone's strong emotions overwhelm them.</p><p>this is different than in everyday circumstances. &nbsp;when someone feels overwhelmed by their own or someone else's feelings, there is no one who asks reflective questions.</p><p>last, people get better in therapy because often therapy is the first time the person has a chance to trust someone with their confidential information and know this information will always be protected.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?### Assistant: <p>i will work with clients and continually review progress with them and determine if counseling is helping.&nbsp; if a client appears to have less to talk about in sessions, appears more stable for a period of time and has reached therapeutic goals i will talk about termination.&nbsp; some clients however i may continue with on a monthly or bi monthly process to allow for check-ins to see how they are doing and if they need more help at that time.<br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: after first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?### Assistant: <p>after meeting a client, many counselors will ask you lots of questions in order to complete a thorough assessment of what you came to counseling for. this assessment is required by most insurances and allows the counselor to give a diagnosis, which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the counselor. if you are paying out of pocket, this diagnosis is not really required for payment, but many counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us. the better we understand what it is that bothers you, what you would like to get out of the counseling, and all the various things that tend to affect people such as family upbringing and medical issues, the easier it is for us to help you reach those goals. how the counseling actually plays out from there depends a lot on the theory that the counselor uses to direct their approach to counseling, and that information is too much for this little post.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i start counseling/therapy in a few days (i'm freaking out) but my main fear is that i'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?### Assistant: <p>many people cry during their therapy sessions. actually most people cry in their therapist's office. i tell my clients that it's safe to cry in my office and crying isn't a sign of weakness. it's a normal human response to pain. people actually do more harm to themselves by trying not to cry than by crying. crying is very cleansing and an important part of the healing process for many people.<br></p>"}
{"text": "### Human: how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?### Assistant: <p>in general, i usually let the client decide when this should occur, sometimes with some clients it will be a joint agreement, but even in that case it should weigh mostly on what the client feels. in short, therapy ends when you feel your done.</p><p>c<br></p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i need help knowing how to deal with stress. what can i do?### Assistant: <p>something different works for each of us.</p><p>there are the outward answers of self-pampering and making your home and work environment as pleasant as possible.</p><p>a deeper level way to decrease stress is through exercise or alternative practices like yoga or tai chi.</p><p>if the stress is more deeply rooted than temporarily feeling irritated for a few days, then give yourself some time to reflect and clarify what the meaning of the stress is to you.</p><p>self-understanding and appreciating your efforts to know yourself may decrease stress because you'll be more focused and attentive to who you are. &nbsp;this will influence you overall to make good decisions for yourself and these will naturally be ones which decrease stress as much as possible.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather.  how can i fight this?### Assistant: <p>one theory is that instead of \"fighting\" your feelings, accept your sad feelings and work with them. &nbsp; feeling sad may open many doors to reflect and make peace with the source of your sadness.</p><p>also, i believe fighting against the natural cycle of rest and hibernation may not even be possible to succeed. &nbsp; winter for most creatures is a time of withdrawal and slowdown. &nbsp;our bodies and moods are part of nature as well. &nbsp;fighting what is part of nature seems like a tiring fight which the person will lose.</p><p>last point, there are the winter holidays to break up the dark and cold of winter. &nbsp; maybe you can invent some of your own winter celebrations so you'll have a few gatherings to look forward to hosting.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: my boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction. we recently got into a fight and he has become very distant.  i don't know what to do to fix the relationship.### Assistant: <p>i would first suggest you sitting down with him and voicing your concerns about how distant he has been, or more importantly you have felt that he is. &nbsp;this will give clarification to the situation as we need to remember that everyone's perception can be different. remember that relationships take work and take communication.</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: how does a person start the counseling process?### Assistant: <p>i think it is important that you are able to convey what you are looking for in a therapist even if that changes over time. &nbsp;you need to look at it like you are interviewing the counselor and that they will be able to provide you with the therapy you need. &nbsp;to many times we do not know and it ends up not being a good fit and then people are left with a bad experience and do not want to re-engage. &nbsp;remembering you are basically hiring someone to help you so i would treat it as such. do some research and be clear as to why you are coming to therapy and ask questions as how they will be able to help you.&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i have a friend that who i used to be in a relationship with. it was brief and turned into us being just good friends.\n\ni spent the weekend with him and  it upset my boyfriend. was i wrong?### Assistant: <p>the most important thing to ask yourself here is, \"how did this action affect my relationship, and is it worth the consequences?\" regardless of your intentions in this action, your boyfriend is uncomfortable with this type of behavior. from here, we can objectively decide if spending time with your previous partner (because that is likely what your boyfriend sees them as) is worth harming the relationship you currently have. it is very rare that a person would be comfortable with their partner spending more than a very little amount of time with their exes. many times, it just gives the wrong impressions. it is very possible that your partner may believe that since you spend so much time with them, that they are still a contender for the most intimate relationship you have to offer, and truth be told, they kind of are. the best intimate relationships, are friendships first and foremost.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>it is also a good thing to consider what you are getting out of the relationship with your ex that you are not getting out of the relationship with your current boyfriend. if you go to this person for emotional support before your boyfriend, then it is very likely you're involved in some \"emotional infidelity\". when we turn to others instead of our partner, it is as if we \"ran into another person's arms\" instead of theirs. no matter who you are, that hurts.&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: how does a person start the counseling process?### Assistant: <p>approaching a counselor can seem intimidating at first, but most mental health professionals want to help you feel safe and heard. &nbsp;you can often find counselors using search engines like counselchat or psychology today. &nbsp;these websites allow you to get to know therapists before you take the next step. &nbsp;these days, counselors have websites where you can learn even more. &nbsp;these websites usually have clear instructions for contact. &nbsp;typically, you can reach out via phone or email to request a consultation. &nbsp;during a consultation call, you can ask the therapist questions about their credentials and areas of expertise. &nbsp;if you feel like you connect, you can schedule a first session where you will tell them more about yourself and why you are seeking therapy. &nbsp;the thing to remember is that therapists want you to reach out to them, and they are happy to be approached for support. &nbsp;good luck! &nbsp;</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: i just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. my family and i really need this job.\n\npeople keep telling me i have \"anxiety\" and i'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. this is all new to me. what can i do?### Assistant: <p>first of all, congratulations on your new role! transitions can be challenging, and it sounds like you are experiencing a lot of change. &nbsp;this would be difficult for many people, and it seems that you have an added layer of challenge. &nbsp;i recommend&nbsp;visiting a therapist to determine the root cause of your anxiety and working to unravel those causes piece by piece. i know seeing a therapist can be challenging when traveling, and online counseling could be a good solution. in the meantime, here are a few of my favorite anxiety stopping strategies. &nbsp;1. grounding exercises: when you feel your anxiety increasing, take a deep breath and begin things in your room (or where ever you are) that have things in common. for example, name all of the blue things that you can see. &nbsp;you can also do non-visual grounding&nbsp;exercises like&nbsp;naming all of the hte&nbsp;sports teams you can think of or all of the state capitals. &nbsp;this will get your mind off of your anxiety and connect you to space. &nbsp;2. the pretzel: this is a seated pose that will stop any anxiety attack in its tracks. &nbsp;start in a seated position and cross your dominate leg over your nondominant leg. then, stretch your arms out in front of you with the back of your hands facing one another. &nbsp;cross your arms in front of each other so that your palms are touching. &nbsp;flip your arms into your body. &nbsp;you will end with your elbows by your side and your hands crossed under your chin. &nbsp;close your eyes and take long breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. &nbsp;this calming pose will help you get through even the toughest of panic episodes. 3. bilateral stimulation and visualization: start in a seated position with your hands placed on your knees. tap each knee in an alternating pattern. close your eyes and begin visualizing a peaceful setting. the combination of bilateral stimulation and visualization will help calm your body and mind. &nbsp;i could go on and on, but these techniques should get you started. &nbsp;these techniques should help you manage anxiety in a pinch. &nbsp;best of luck!&nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: how do i make myself happy without the people who made me happy? now that theyâ€™re gone, i feel sad. itâ€™s been two months now but i seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.### Assistant: <p>hello. so, someone made you happy but is no longer around? i am sure that feels devastating. as a counselor i usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external, rather than the internal side of a person's life. happiness is formed within ourselves. all the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting, and temporary. even relationships fo not last forever. if we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives, then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. we are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace, or resolution to a specific problem.</p><p>what i would offer to you, is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. what do you like about your life as it is right now? what can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? these kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. mourning the loss of a social connection (in whatever way that occurred), is part of the grieving process, but it is not permanent. it is a path to healing and moving forward. from this, you can seek out new sources of happiness. i encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. happiness is an expression of the internal feelings, so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. if you are lacking in happiness, then it becomes important to examine why that is, and what you can do about it to promote self-care. seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the grief/loss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.</p><p>i wish you happiness for every day of your life.</p><p>best wishes.</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: how does a person start the counseling process?### Assistant: <p>the easiest way to start the counseling process is to do a little research online. a quick search for the type of counseling you are looking for can be helpful. there are lots of counselors out there to choose from, so many times you will have to take it a few steps further than that. check out their website, social media, and any reviews (but remember, people are not always very nice). if you plan on using insurance to pay for at least part of the services, look for one that is in your network. you can find out if someone is in your network by looking for providers on your insurance's website. if your coverage isn't that great and you know you're going to be paying for it all anyway (because you're an all-star and verified your coverage already with the insurance company), then you can really pick any counselor you want, but working with one that is at least out of network will give you the benefit of having it applied to your deductible. if you have any questions about that process or just want some help in getting your benefits from the insurance company once you've started counseling, <a href=\"https://getbetter.co/\" target=\"_blank\">better</a> is a good option. once you've found a counselor you think is a good fit for you, normally the best step to take here is to call and schedule your very first appointment. with many counselors you can now send an email, but a phone call can normally tell you quite a bit about someone and their clinic. once you're all scheduled, they will either get you to do some paperwork before you come in, or many times they just let you fill it out once you get there. from there, all you have to do is show up!</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: how does a person start the counseling process?### Assistant: <p>most counselors are very approachable and many offer a 15 minute chat by phone to allow you to talk about your issue, and to get a feel for the counselor. &nbsp;if you like what you hear by phone, the next step is to set up a face-to-face meeting. studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor. &nbsp;trust your instincts and if you don't feel comfortable, let him or her know that you don't think it's a good fit. &nbsp;many counselors list on websites like psychology today and good therapy. &nbsp;visit these websites to learn more about therapists in your area.</p>"}

(it might not be driving for you, but you get the idea! :)). &nbsp;it might be taking a walk instead of smoking on your break at work. &nbsp;</p><p>2. &nbsp;create distance between you and the habit you are trying to break. &nbsp;this approach could be used in a variety of different ways. &nbsp;if you smoke first thing in the morning, consider leaving your cigarettes in a different room in your home. &nbsp;walking the extra couple of feet could help you decide not to smoke. &nbsp; leave your credit or debit cards at home and carry less emergency cash than a pack of cigarettes. &nbsp;with this strategy, you are trying to create some distance between you the cigarettes so that you have to jump through extra hoops to get them. &nbsp;</p><p>3. &nbsp;consider cutting back before cutting out. &nbsp;if you are smoking 10 cigarettes a day, try smoking 9. then cut back to 8 and so on. &nbsp;having a plan to reduce harm may be more sustainable than cutting things out altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>4. &nbsp;you could also talk to your doctor about the safety of nicotine patches. if you aren't already pregnant, this could be a great resource to help boost your success. &nbsp;</p><p>5. focus on what you are gaining instead of what you are loosing. you may be losing cigarettes,&nbsp;but you are gaining money, health, taste buds, an increased sense of smell, lung capacity, a healthy baby etc. &nbsp;you could plan small rewards/ treats with the money you save from decreasing cigarette purchases. &nbsp;i recommend&nbsp;making these purchases small and frequent to keep up the momentum rather than waiting for a big payout a couple of months down the road. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>good luck! cutting out cigarettes will be good for you and your baby. &nbsp;</p>"}

{"text": "### Human: i start counseling/therapy in a few days (i'm freaking out) but my main fear is that i'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?### Assistant: <p>hi there ! &nbsp;as someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years , i would say that crying is nothing to worry about at all ! almost every single person i have worked with has cried at one point or another. &nbsp;starting therapy takes a lot of courage; when you work with a therapist ,once you feel safe , &nbsp;you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before. &nbsp;i have seen &nbsp;people cry with sadness , cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time, cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard. &nbsp; i myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>i can assure you that most , if not all , therapists expect clients to cry &nbsp;and there is nothing to be embarrassed about. &nbsp; crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down. &nbsp; crying is &nbsp;often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal .</p><p>so , to summarize , don't worry at all about crying! it will probably feel uncomfortable &nbsp;at first , but i promise you , you will not be judged for crying in therapy. &nbsp; and it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and won't judge you !</p><p>good luck !!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"}
{"text": "### Human: my ex-wife married and used me to have a child. she now uses that child as a pawn. i know my child misses me, but i need to move on and not live in the past. how do i do this? do i see my child as much as possible or very little? is it more confusing for the child?### Assistant: <p>the thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life. children have a way of making things their fault, even when they have done nothing wrong. because of this, when parents cut off contact, the child thinks it's their fault.&nbsp;</p><p>as hard as that already is for a child, it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life. this makes the belief even more strong for them. they start to think, \"why does dad keep leaving? what am i doing to keep making him go away?\"</p><p>i believe a child needs both parents in their life. whether she used you for a child or not, that child still exists and never asked for this. they didn't ask to be born into drama and two parents that can't make things work.&nbsp;</p><p>you can move on and start over while still maintaining a relationship with your child. if you start over far away, this may mean less visits but you'll still be a part of their life. just make sure when you make a commitment to this child to stick to it. every child deserves that much.&nbsp;</p><p>good luck to you! :-)</p>"}
{"text": "### Human: my grandson's step-mother sends him to school with a pink barbie backpack as a form of punishment.### Assistant: <p>absolutely not!&nbsp;</p><p>it is never in a child's best interest to use humiliation as punishment. this can lead to issues in the relationship between parent and child as well as the child's social relationships. kids have a hard enough time. to then go and cause them embarrassment is unconscionable.&nbsp;</p><p>the entire job of a parent is to prepare their child to become a successful, healthy adult. you do this by using healthy ways to teach a child when they make a mistake. discipline shouldn't be seen as punishment. it should be seen as a way to teach a lesson. what lesson could this possibility be teaching him? absolutely nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>meanwhile, she is most likely damaging her relationship with him and causing great distress in his school day and peer interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>she should be one of the people he can come to when he's hurting; not someone who causes him pain.</p>"}
